A 21-year-old Florida woman says she spent $20,000 for a third breast to make herself \"unattractive to men.\" The admittedly \"crazy\" massage therapist, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, told an Orlando radio station in a bizarre interview that she had the plastic surgery because she doesn't want to date anymore. \"Well, I am crazy,\" she told the \"The News Junkie\" show last week. \"Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.\" She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station. Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV. When asked about her new addition, she told \"The News Junkie\" that \"to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.\" Many people believe that Tridevil's claim is a hoax, since she has not provided any real proof. Skeptics say the pics of her with the third breast are Photoshopped. \"I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,\" she told 10 News in Tampa. However, when the TV station asked for some verification, she gave the camera just \"a quick flash,\" according to the report. She wouldn't show more because \"I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show,\" she told the station. Her parents, though, apparently took her seriously. \"I told my mom on camera,\" she told the station. \"(She) ran out the door.\" dboroff@nydailynews.com USING MOBILE? CLICK FOR VIDEO"}
