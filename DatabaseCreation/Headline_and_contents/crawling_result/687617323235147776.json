His death was confirmed on Thursday by his family who said that he died \u201csurrounded by family and friends\u201d. Rickman had been suffering from cancer.A star whose arch features and languid diction were recognisable across the generations, Rickman found a fresh legion of fans with his role as Professor Snape in the Harry Potter films. Cast and crew on those movies were among the first to pay tribute to the actor. In a lengthy post, Daniel Radcliffe wrote that Rickman was \u201cone of the greatest actors I will ever work with\u201d as well as \u201cone of the loyalest and most supportive people I\u2019ve ever met in the film industry\u201d.JK Rowling, who wrote the Harry Potter books, said: \u201cThere are no words to express how shocked and devastated I am to hear of Alan Rickman\u2019s death. He was a magnificent actor & a wonderful man\u201d, while Michael Gambon, who played Dumbledore, said: \u201cEverybody loved Alan. He was always happy and fun and creative and very, very funny.\u201dThe actor had been a big-screen staple since first shooting to global acclaim in 1988, when he starred as Hans Gruber, Bruce Willis\u2019s sardonic, dastardly adversary in Die Hard \u2013 a part he was offered two days after arriving in Los Angeles, aged 41.Gruber was the first of three memorable baddies played by Rickman: he was an outrageous sheriff of Nottingham in 1991\u2019s Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, as well as a terrifying Rasputin in an acclaimed 1995 HBO film. But Rickman was also a singular leading man: in 1991, he starred as a cellist opposite Juliet Stevenson in Anthony Minghella\u2019s affecting supernatural romance Truly, Madly, Deeply; four years later he was the honourable and modest Col Brandon in Sense and Sensibility, starring and scripted by Emma Thompson. He was to reunite with Thompson many times: they played husband and wife in 2003\u2019s Love, Actually and former lovers in 2010 BBC drama The Song of Lunch. In 1995, he directed Thompson and her mother, Phyllida Law, in his directorial debut, the acclaimed Scottish drama The Winter Guest. Thompson \u2013 who said she had \u201cjust kissed him goodbye\u201d \u2013 wrote: What I remember most in this moment of painful leave-taking is his humour, intelligence, wisdom and kindness. His capacity to fell you with a look or lift you with a word. The intransigence which made him the great artist he was \u2013 his ineffable and cynical wit, the clarity with which he saw most things, including me, and the fact that he never spared me the view. I learned a lot from him. He was the finest of actors and directors. I couldn\u2019t wait to see what he was going to do with his face next. I consider myself hugely privileged to have worked with him so many times and to have been directed by him. He was the ultimate ally. In life, art and politics. I trusted him absolutely. He was, above all things, a rare and unique human being and we shall not see his like again.Last year, Rickman reunited with Kate Winslet, another Sense and Sensibility co-star, for his second film as director, A Little Chaos \u2013 a period romance set in the gardens of Versailles. Yet it was Rickman\u2019s work on stage that established him as such a compelling talent, and to which he returned throughout his career. After graduating from Rada, the actor supported himself as a dresser for the likes of Nigel Hawthorne and Ralph Richardson before finding work with the Royal Shakespeare Company (as well as on TV as the slithery Reverend Slope in The Barchester Chronicles). His sensational breakthrough came in 1986 as Valmont, the mordant seducer in Christopher Hampton\u2019s Les Liaisons Dangereuses. He was nominated for a Tony for the part; Lindsay Duncan memorably said of her co-star\u2019s sonorous performance that audiences would leave the theatre wanting to have sex \u201cand preferably with Alan Rickman\u201d.He and Duncan \u2013 as well as their director, Howard Davies \u2013 reunited in 2002 for Noel Coward\u2019s Private Lives, which transferred to Broadway after a successful run in London. Other key stage performances included Mark Antony opposite Helen Mirren\u2019s Cleopatra at the Olivier Theatre in London, and the title role in Ibsen\u2019s John Gabriel Borkman at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in 2010 \u2013 again with Duncan, and again transferring to New York. The following year he starred as a creative writing professor in Seminar on Broadway.In 2005, Rickman directed the award-winning play My Name is Rachel Corrie, which he and Katharine Viner \u2013 now Guardian editor-in-chief \u2013 compiled from the emails of the student who was killed by a bulldozer while protesting against the actions of the Israel Defense Forces in the Gaza Strip. Rickman remained politically active throughout his life: he was born, he said, \u201ca card-carrying member of the Labour party\u201d, and was highly involved with charities including Saving Faces and the International Performers\u2019 Aid Trust, which seeks to help artists in developing and poverty-stricken countries. Rickman publicly spoke of his unhappiness about the \u201cHollywood ending\u201d of 1996 film Michael Collins, a historical biopic of the Irish civil war, in which he portrayed \u00c9amon de Valera, and expressed his belief that art ought to help educate as well as entertain. \u201cTalent is an accident of genes, and a responsibility,\u201d he once said.He and his wife, Rima Horton, met when they were still teenagers; she became an economics lecturer as well as a Labour party councillor. In 2012, the pair married, having been together since 1965. The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was one of the first to pay tribute on Twitter, followed by former leader Ed Miliband. Others offering condolences included Stephen Fry, Eddie Izzard, Charlie Sheen, Mia Farrow and Richard E Grant. Many drew parallels between the deaths of Rickman and David Bowie, from the same disease at the same age and in the same week.Rickman was an actor unafraid of the unexpected. He voiced a monarch in an episode of cult cartoon King of the Hill and a megalomaniac pilot fish called Joe in the Danish animator Help! I\u2019m A Fish. In 2000, Rickman appeared as Sharleen Spiteri\u2019s love interest in the music video for Texas\u2019s 2000 hit \u2018In Demand\u2019, which involves them tangoing at a petrol station. In 2015, Rickman again featured in the video for one of their singles, this time with vocals.He spoofed his own persona in comedy Galaxy Quest (2000), in which he plays a Shakespearian-trained actor who has found fame as a Spock-style alien in a long-running sci-fi series and in Victoria Wood\u2019s Christmas special of the same year, as an upright colonel at the Battle of Waterloo.Rickman was sanguine about his legions of admirers, who declared their love on countless websites, video tributes and at stage doors. Even scientists were not immune: in 2008, linguistics professors concluded that the most appealing male voice mixes elements of Rickman, Gambon and Jeremy Irons. Recent film roles included an art-loving lord in the Coen brothers\u2019 scripted farce Gambit (2012), as Ronald Reagan in Lee Daniels\u2019s The Butler \u2013 and a humorous, imperious King Louis XIV in A Little Chaos. Rickman is still to be seen in Eye in the Sky, a thriller about drone warfare that won rave reviews at the Toronto film festival last year, and repeating his voiceover as Absolem the Caterpillar in Alice Through the Looking Glass, also due for release later this year.His final job was taping a voiceover for a short film called This Tortoise Could Save a Life, in aid of Save the Children and Refugee Council. Released in mid December 2015, the film\u2019s audio was recorded at Rickman\u2019s home in London at the end of November.That Rickman never won an Oscar (he did receive a Golden Globe, an Emmy, a Bafta and many more) became a perennial topic in interviews but did not seem to trouble the actor himself. \u201cParts win prizes, not actors,\u201d he said in 2008. It was the wider worth of his art to which Rickman remained committed, saying that he found it easier to treat the work seriously if he could look upon himself with levity. \u201cActors are agents of change,\u201d he said. \u201cA film, a piece of theatre, a piece of music, or a book can make a difference. It can change the world.\u201d \u2018We are all so devastated\u2019: acting world pays tribute to Alan Rickman"}
