Ecologist Dr Derek Lee, founder of the Wild Nature Institute (WNI), which conducts scientific research on at-risk wildlife species, took the amazing photographs in Tarangire National Park. \u201cOmo is leucistic, meaning many of the skin cells are incapable of making a pigment. Some are, so she is pale but not pure white, with red or blue eyes, as a true albino would be,\u201d he explained. \u201cOmo is the only pale giraffe we are currently aware of, but we have also observed leucistic waterbuck, Cape buffalo and ostrich in Tarangire. \u201cOmo appears to get along with the other giraffes, she has always been seen with a large group of normally coloured giraffe, they don't seem to mind her different colouring.\u201dHowever he warned that her unique colour could make her a target for poachers in the African park. He added: \u201cOmo is now 15 months old. She survived her first year as a small calf, which is the most dangerous time for a young giraffe due to lion, leopard and hyena preying on them. \u201cHer chances of surviving to adulthood are good but adult giraffes are regularly poached for bush meat, and her colouration might make her a target. \u201cWe and our partners are working on giraffe conservation and anti-poaching to help give Omo and her relatives a better chance of survival. \u201cWe hope that she lives a long life and that someday she has calves of her own.\u201dThe WNI blog adds: \u201cWe were lucky enough to see her again this January, almost exactly one year [after the first sighting]. \u201cWe are thrilled that she is still alive and well. A local lodge guide christened her Omo, after a popular brand of detergent here.\u201d"}
