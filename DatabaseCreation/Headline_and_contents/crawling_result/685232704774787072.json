Such was the case on January 3, 2016, when\u00a0Transport Quebec's traffic camera\u00a0snapped several pictures of an owl mid-flight. The photos of the majestic animal's flyby were taken right by highway 40 in Montreal.\u00a0Quebec transport minister Robert Po\u00ebti\u00a0tweeted the pictures earlier today:\u00a0Magnifique harfang des neiges capt\u00e9 par les cam\u00e9ras de surveillance du r\u00e9seau routier sur l'A-40 dans l'ouest de MTL pic.twitter.com/ivaKZDel9r\u2014 Robert Po\u00ebti (@robertpoeti) January 7, 2016The caption in English, courtesy of Google Translate: \"Beautiful snowy owl taken up by the road network surveillance cameras on the A-40 in western MTL.\"Barbara Frei, director of the McGill Bird Observatory, spoke with the\u00a0CBC about what she suspected was a young female snowy owl. \"I think they are attracted specifically to the highway because it has open, grassy fields nearby which is perfect for hunting their favorite prey, which is small rodents,\" she said. \"They like to get a good lay of the land and the high lamp posts or other posts that they can perch on while hunting just suits them perfectly.\""}
