How the Ferguson PD ran the town where Michael Brown was gunned down. Special CorrespondentPolice in Ferguson, Missouri, once charged a man with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms while four of them allegedly beat him.\u201cOn and/or about the 20th day of Sept. 20, 2009 at or near 222 S. Florissant within the corporate limits of Ferguson, Missouri, the above named defendant did then and there unlawfully commit the offense of \u2018property damage\u2019 to wit did transfer blood to the uniform,\u201d reads the charge sheet.The address is the headquarters of the Ferguson Police Department, where a 52-year-old welder named Henry Davis was taken in the predawn hours on that date. He had been arrested for an outstanding warrant that proved to actually be for another man of the same surname, but a different middle name and Social Security number.\u201cI said, \u2018I told you guys it wasn\u2019t me,\u2019\u201d Davis later testified.He recalled the booking officer saying, \u201cWe have a problem.\u201dThe booking officer had no other reason to hold Davis, who ended up in Ferguson only because he missed the exit for St. Charles and then pulled off the highway because the rain was so heavy he could not see to drive. The cop who had pulled up behind him must have run his license plate and assumed he was that other Henry Davis. Davis said the cop approached his vehicle, grabbed his cellphone from his hand, cuffed him and placed him in the back seat of the patrol car, without a word of explanation.But the booking officer was not ready just to let Davis go, and proceeded to escort him to a one-man cell that already had a man in it asleep on the lone bunk. Davis says that he asked the officer if he could at least have one of the sleeping mats that were stacked nearby.\u201dHe said I wasn\u2019t getting one,\u201d Davis said.Davis balked at being a second man in a one-man cell.\u201cBecause it\u2019s 3 in the morning,\u201d he later testified. \u201cWho going to sleep on a cement floor?\u201dThe booking officer summoned a number of fellow cops. One opened the cell door while another suddenly charged, propelling Davis inside and slamming him against the back wall.\u201cI told the police officers there that I didn\u2019t do nothing, \u2018Why is you guys doing this to me?\u2019\u201d Davis testified. \u201cThey said, \u2018OK, just lay on the ground and put your hands behind your back.\u2019\u201dDavis said he complied and that a female officer straddled and then handcuffed him. Two other officers crowded into the cell.\u201cThey started hitting me,\u201d he testified. \u201cI was getting hit and I just covered up.\u201dThe other two stepped out and the female officer allegedly lifted Davis\u2019 head as the cop who had initially pushed him into the cell reappeared.\u201cHe ran in and kicked me in the head,\u201d Davis recalled. \u201cI almost passed out at that point\u2026 Paramedics came\u2026 They said it was too much blood, I had to go to the hospital.\u201dA patrol car took the bleeding Davis to a nearby emergency room. He refused treatment, demanding somebody first take his picture. \u201cI wanted a witness and proof of what they done to me,\u201d Davis said.He was driven back to the jail, where he was held for several days before he posted $1,500 bond on four counts of \u201cproperty damage.\u201d Police Officer John Beaird had signed complaints swearing on pain of perjury that Davis had bled on his uniform and those of three fellow officers.The remarkable turned inexplicable when Beaird was deposed in a civil case that Davis subsequently brought seeking redress and recompense. \u201cAfter Mr. Davis was detained, did you have any blood on you?\u201d asked Davis\u2019 lawyer, James Schottel.  \u201cNo, sir,\u201d Beaird replied.Schottel showed Beaird a copy of the \u201cproperty damage\u201d complaint.\u201cIs that your signature as complainant?\u201d the lawyer asked.\u201cIt is, sir,\u201d the cop said.\u201cAnd what do you allege that Mr. Davis did unlawfully in this one?\u201d the lawyer asked.\u201cTransferred blood to my uniform while Davis was resisting,\u201d the cop said.\u201cAnd didn\u2019t I ask you earlier in this deposition if Mr. Davis got blood on your uniform?\u201d\u201cYou did, sir.\u201d\u201cAnd didn\u2019t you respond no?\u201d\u201cCorrect. I did.\u201dBeaird seemed to be either admitting perjury or committing it. The depositions of other officers suggested that the \u201cproperty damage\u201d charges were not just bizarre, but trumped up.\u201cThere was no blood on my uniform,\u201d said Police Officer Christopher Pillarick.And then there was Officer Michael White, the one accused of kicking Davis in the head, an allegation he denies, as his fellow officers deny striking Davis. White had reported suffering a bloody nose in the mayhem.\u201cDid you see Mr. Davis bleeding at all?\u201d  the lawyer, Schottel, asked.\u201cI did not,\u201d White replied.\u201cDid Mr. Davis get any blood on you while you were in the cell?\u201d Schottel asked.\u201cNo,\u201d White said.The contradictions between the complaint and the depositions apparently are what prompted the prosecutor to drop the \u201cproperty damage\u201d allegation. The prosecutor also dropped a felony charge of assault on an officer that had been lodged more than a year after the incident and shortly after Davis filed his civil suit.Davis suggested in his testimony that if the police really thought he had assaulted an officer he would have been charged back when he was jailed.\u201cThey would have filed those charges right then and there, because that\u2019s a major felony,\u201d he noted.Indisputable evidence of what transpired in the cell might have been provided by a surveillance camera, but it turned out that the VHS video was recorded at 32 times normal speed.\u201cIt was like a blur,\u201d Schottel told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see anything.\u201dThe blur proved to be from 12 hours after the incident anyway. The cops had saved the wrong footage after Schottel asked them to preserve it.Schottel got another unpleasant surprise when he sought the use-of-force history of the officers involved. He learned that before a new chief took over in 2010 the department had a surprising protocol for non-fatal use-of-force reports.\u201cThe officer himself could complete it and give it to the supervisor for his approval,\u201d the prior chief, Thomas Moonier, testified in a deposition. \u201cI would read it. It would be placed in my out basket, and my secretary would probably take it and put it with the case file.\u201dNo copy was made for the officer\u2019s personnel file.\u201cEverything involved in an incident would generally be with the police report,\u201d Moonier said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they maintain in personnel files.\u201d\u201cWho was in charge of personnel files, of maintaining them?\u201d Schottel asked.\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Moonier said. \u201cI believe City Hall, but I don\u2019t know.\u201dSchottel focused on the date of the incident.\u201cOn September 20th, 2009, was there any way to identify any officers that were subject of one or more citizens\u2019 complaints?\u201d he asked.\u201cNot to my knowledge,\u201d Moonier said.\u201cWas there any way to identify any officers who had completed several use-of-force reports?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201dBut however lax the department\u2019s system and however contradictory the officers\u2019 testimony, a federal magistrate ruled that the apparent perjury about the \u201cproperty damage\u201d charges was too minor to constitute a violation of due process and that Davis\u2019 injuries were de minimis\u2014too minor to warrant a finding of excessive force. Never mind that a CAT scan taken after the incident confirmed that he had suffered a concussion.Schottel has appealed and expects to argue the case in December. He will contend that perjury is perjury however minor the charge and note that both the NFL and Major League Baseball have learned to consider a concussion a serious injury.Schottel figures the courts might take the problems of the Ferguson Police Department as more than de minimis as a result of the protests sparked when an officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old named Michael Brown on the afternoon of Aug. 9.\u201cYour chances on appeal are going up,\u201d a fellow lawyer told him.At least one witness has said that Brown was shot in the back and then in the chest and head as he turned toward the officer with his hands raised. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, that doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u2019\u201d Schottel told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. \u201cI said I already know about Ferguson, nothing new can faze me about Ferguson.\u201dSchottel has also deposed the new chief, Thomas Jackson, who took over in 2010. Jackson testified that he has instituted a centralized system whereby all complaints lodged against cops by citizens or supervisors go through him and are assigned a number in an internal affairs log. Schottel views Jackson as \u201cnot a bad guy,\u201d someone who has been trying to make positive change.\u201cHe wants to do right, but it was such a mess,\u201d Schottel said Wednesday.Jackson has seemed less than progressive as he delayed identifying the officer involved in the shooting for fear it would place him and his family in danger. Jackson would only say the officer is white and has been on the job for six years. This means that for his first two and most formative years the officer might have been writing his own force reports and that none of them went into his file. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get people to clean things up, especially if they\u2019re used to doing things a certain way,\u201d Schottel said.On  Friday, police finally identified the officer as Darren Wilson, who is  said to have no disciplinary record, as such records are  kept in Ferguson. We already know that he started out at a time when it  was accepted for a Ferguson cop to charge somebody with property damage  for bleeding on his uniform and later saying there was no blood on him at  all."}
