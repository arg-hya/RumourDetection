Over 65 percent of black US citizens don\u2019t trust the justice system to deal with the guilty, while 40 percent of the white population don\u2019t believe in the system either.When asked if the police treat the black population more severely than the white population, 53 percent agreed, while 31 percent said police officers treat everyone the same.Minorities in the US usually express mistrust toward law enforcement officials: for instance, a Gallup poll carried out last year revealed that the white population is 12 percentage points more likely to be confident of the police actions than the non-white population.The poll was conducted August 11-14 among 1,000 US adults, 116 of them black, using a sample chosen from YouGov\u2019s online panel. Factors taken into account were: age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance, HuffPost said.The poll follows an escalation of violence after the killing of Brown, 18, by a white police officer. During the protests, police used rubber bullets and tear gas, and detained several journalists.The latest accounts of justifiable homicide reported to the FBI stated that almost twice a week in the US a white policeman killed a black person \u2013 that\u2019s over a seven-year period that ended in 2012.
