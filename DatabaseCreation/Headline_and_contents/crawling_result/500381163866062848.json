The police served an outstanding warrant to one Henry Davis, 52, according to the Beast \u2014 but they were actually looking for a different Henry Davis who had a different middle name and Social Security number. But after the police apparently ran Davis\u2019s license plate number and saw his name, he was pulled over and arrested, the Daily Beast reported.Davis was then taken to the police department and placed in a holding cell, according to the Beast, citing Davis\u2019s testimony. When he complained about being placed with another person in a one-man cell and asked for a sleeping mat, police officers allegedly slammed his head against the wall, hit him and kicking him in the head, per the Beast. Davis was eventually taken to the emergency room.He was charged with property damage, according to the Beast, with the charging documents stating that Davis \u201cdid transfer blood to the uniform.\u201dThe local prosecutor later dropped the property damage charges, the Beast reported, because of conflicting reports from the officers involved. Afterward, Davis sued the department over the incident, but court documents show that a federal district judge ruled in favor of the Ferguson police in the last year.Davis appealed the district judge\u2019s ruling to federal appeals court in March 2014.
