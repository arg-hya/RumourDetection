Now, the actress is back with a trio of standout performances in indie films. She opens up about her latest chapter.Senior Entertainment EditorKristen Stewart looks like a new woman. Yes, it\u2019s an odd thing to say about a 24-year-old, but the steely-eyed Angeleno isn\u2019t your typical twenty-something. At age 11, she tackled a pivotal seizure sequence for David Fincher in Panic Room with such ferocity that she burst several blood vessels in her eyes. \u201cShe reminded me of a young Jodie Foster,\u201d said Fincher. She\u2019s been forged in the crucible of Hollywood, enduring a polarizing film franchise (Twilight), tabloid controversy, and incessant scrutiny\u2014and emerged all the wiser. These days, she\u2019s decidedly more Joan Jett than Bella Swan.Stewart\u2019s just emerged from her slumber and met me at the lobby lounge of the Greenwich Hotel, a hipper-than-thou hotel in Downtown New York, looking effortlessly striking in a baggy white T\u2014exposing a right forearm tattoo of the illuminated eye in Picasso\u2019s Guernica\u2014black jeans, and short, dark hair. She got the bit of body art after wrapping Clouds of Sils Maria, a Swiss-set surrealist flick helmed by French master Olivier Assayas and also starring Juliette Binoche. It\u2019s one of three indie films that\u2019s earned Stewart heavy acclaim on the festival circuit, along with her gripping turn as a daughter struggling to cope with her mother\u2019s  (Julianne Moore) deterioration from Alzheimer\u2019s in Still Alice, for which she\u2019ll receive a \u201cmajor Oscar push\u201d from distributor Sony Pictures Classics, and last but not least, as PFC Amy Cole, a green guard at Guant\u00e1namo in Camp X-Ray, in theaters Oct. 17. In Camp X-Ray, her guard is initially happy to serve her country in the wake of 9/11, but after observing the treatment of the prisoners there, and striking up an unlikely friendship with one of the detainees (Peyman Maadi, A Separation), she begins to have a change of heart.After ordering coffee, we discuss her resurgence.Camp X-Ray was shot on a shoestring budget of $1 million, but it looks much bigger than that.It\u2019s weird to say that the scope of it is pretty small considering what you see, but if you think about it, we had essentially three locations and shot it in 20 days. The key to the budget is it was so fast and we just gunned it.It had been two years since you shot your last film, Snow White and the Huntsman. Were you being extra picky in the wake of Twilight because you knew you were under the microscope?I\u2019m never really that precious about choosing projects that don\u2019t have every sure element that is a guaranteed good experience and/or success. There\u2019s a lot of risk involved in this job, and it doesn\u2019t bother me. This could\u2019ve been a terrible movie! It could\u2019ve been awful. It\u2019s with a first-time director. But I still would\u2019ve gotten what I got out of it had the movie not turned out as well as it did.You tend to take those leaps. I remember Leonardo DiCaprio once saying that he has a policy of never working with first-time directors.It\u2019s smart. I\u2019ve had experiences that have made me go, \u201cUgh, I have to be careful and make sure that every part is sturdy and that I won\u2019t be let down.\u201d If I was a director, I would be extremely conscious of my filmography. It says so much about the difference between putting your name on something and owning it instead of being one tiny part of it. Actors get to work all the time. If I make a bad movie every once in a while, I don\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t work after Snow White for about two years, but it\u2019s because a lot of these projects didn\u2019t come together. I\u2019m decisive, but I\u2019m definitely not a planner.I have these talks with friends, and I\u2019ll say, \u201cKristen Stewart\u2019s a good actress,\u201d and they disagree. Then I ask them what films they\u2019ve seen of yours, and they just say, \u201cThe Twilight movies.\u201d So, they haven\u2019t seen, say, Panic Room, Speak, Into the Wild, Adventureland, etc. Do you feel like that series has unfairly colored people\u2019s opinions of your acting ability?  Honestly, I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m really happy doing what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m sure there are a ton of people out there who would hate my movies even if they saw all those, just as I\u2019m sure there are people out there who are obsessed with Twilight and say, \u201cI watched the series, and she completely let me down, and then I watched every one of her other movies, and I fuckin\u2019 hate her!\u201d And that\u2019s cool! Just don\u2019t watch my movies.With Camp X-Ray, this is pretty heavy subject matter here in Gitmo. President Obama promised to close the place down in 2009, but hasn\u2019t done so yet. Was part of the attraction to the project shining a light in this bizarre blight on America? I was forced to really investigate. I knew that Obama wanted to close it down, and I knew that everyone else wanted to, too. Most people you talk to in America have kind of put it out of their minds. I didn\u2019t jump on this movie to make a huge political statement, but it\u2019s such an interesting story within an interesting context, and it\u2019s more of a poke on the shoulder to remind you that this thing is here.Your character\u2019s relationship with Peyman\u2019s detainee reminds us of the humanity of these people. We tend to view suspected terrorists as this nameless, faceless \u201cother,\u201d when they\u2019re human beings, too.As Americans, we should absolutely aspire to more than that. If you label something \u201cbad,\u201d people will justify the most terrible things. Just because you\u2019re following a greater whole, suddenly you take the individual out of it and no one bears responsibility for anything.The film doesn\u2019t show any of the more controversial practices at Gitmo\u2014like waterboarding, sleep deprivation, force-feeding, etc.   It alludes to it. But if we showed all that stuff, people would instantly demonize the film. You see something like that and it becomes so polarizing. Yes, it was cool to be in a Gitmo movie, it was cool to play a soldier, and it was cool remind people that this still exists, but I also thought it was cool to play a simple, American girl who wanted to find her line and aspire to something bigger than her\u2014only to find that things aren\u2019t so simple. Most people in every state think, \u201cWell, of course it\u2019s a great thing to sign up for the Army,\u201d and there\u2019s no question asked beyond that\u2014ever.She really gets swept up in all the post 9/11 patriotism and signs up for Gitmo duty, only to find that it isn\u2019t what she thought at all.She\u2019s simple, not very smart, and really socially inadequate\u2014but a good person. So, if you can sign up, put a uniform on, and erase yourself, you don\u2019t have to consider yourself anymore. You can take the individual out of it and say, \u201cWell, this dignifies me. I\u2019m good because of this.\u201d And when that doesn\u2019t end up being true, you actually have to contend with who you are. All she wants is to think, \u201cThey did 9/11, they\u2019re bad, fuck that, I\u2019m going to do my job and I\u2019m going to do it well.\u201d But then she gets down there and just can\u2019t accept it; she can\u2019t conform to that.Right. The mistake we make is not viewing these detainees down there as people, too. We\u2019re all people.  That is essentially so fucking evil, it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s a ridiculous idea for you to think that you know anything for sure in life\u2014other than to take care of your fellow people. Where the fuck do you get off thinking otherwise? These two people couldn\u2019t be from more different worlds and perspectives, and probably disagree fundamentally on most things, but there\u2019s a through-line for all of us\u2014and that\u2019s what people forget, and that\u2019s what makes people capable of doing terrible things to each other. What makes you different from any other person that walks the earth?This is a pretty ripped-from-the-headlines film. What issues are you passionate about in the news?I don\u2019t want to talk about that shit at all. Trust me, I\u2019m only asking for it. When it comes time to stand up and affect change, I\u2019m not the type of person to shout from the rooftops. Just because you\u2019re an actor and in the public eye, people think that\u2019s how you must be. But there are other ways to do that. That\u2019s not me.When you talk about Camp X-Ray, Still Alice, and Clouds of Sils Maria, these are three films anchored by strong, flawed, complex women. These films tend to be a rarity in Hollywood, and usually come in smaller indie packages.Me and Juliette [Binoche] were talking about it because this question does come up, and she said, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t answer that question anymore. It\u2019s so clich\u00e9.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s so clich\u00e9 because it\u2019s entirely true.\u201d And she said, \u201cYes, maybe in Hollywood.\u201d Because in France, due to the history of French directors having romantic relationships with their lead actresses, they tend to tell more female-centric stories. In America, there are way more male filmmakers than female ones, and they want to tell more masculine stories. Most of our great films that we\u2019re proud of, you\u2019ve got Bob De Niro, Jack Nicholson, and the bravado is overwhelming. And that\u2019s still going on. I read a million scripts and people say I choose my scripts carefully, but it\u2019s just so obvious when the role is different, and complex, and not some typical, archetypal girl, because they\u2019re so rare. Not to sound clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s a male-dominated and driven business.\u201cIt\u2019s A Man\u2019s World,\u201d to quote James Brown.[Laughs] Yeah. But that\u2019s OK, because it\u2019s fun to be the underdog.There just needs to be more female filmmakers.Exactly! That\u2019s it. I\u2019ll do it.A case study would be your Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke. This is a very accomplished filmmaker and, five years after directing that hit, her latest film basically went straight-to-video. That has to be indicative of  a larger problem within the industry, that she was basically given one Red Riding Hood before her power was stripped away. A male director is given a lot more chances.Yeah, that\u2019s true. That\u2019s a thing that women have to do\u2014you must persevere. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. You need to make something that\u2019s undeniably good. If a woman makes a bad movie, or does something stupid, then the door just slams shut. It\u2019s fucked up.A lot of young actresses these days are coming out against being labeled a feminist. It seems to be a generational thing, where people from the older generation see it for its definition\u2014equality for men and women\u2014while the younger generation for some reason views it as a more divisive term.I know what you mean. That\u2019s such a strange thing to say, isn\u2019t it? Like, what do you mean? Do you not believe in equality for men and women? I think it\u2019s a response to overly-aggressive types. There are a lot of women who feel persecuted and go on about it, and I sometimes am like, \u201cHonestly, just relax, because now you\u2019re going in the other direction.\u201d Sometimes, the loudest voice in the room isn\u2019t necessarily the one you should listen to. By our nature alone, think about what you\u2019re saying and say it\u2014but don\u2019t scream in people\u2019s faces, because then you\u2019re discrediting us.Relating it to my one little avenue, people say, \u201cIf you want to make it in the film industry as a woman, you have to be a bitch.\u201d No, you are going to ruin any chance you have and give us a bad name. It\u2019s the overcompensation to where our generation goes, \u201cRelax,\u201d because it\u2019s been easier for us, and because we don\u2019t have as much of the anger, so it\u2019s like we can\u2019t get behind it and it\u2019s a bit embarrassing. But that being said, it\u2019s a really ridiculous thing to say you\u2019re not a feminist."}
