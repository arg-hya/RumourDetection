Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about.Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home.Alan White is a news editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in London.
