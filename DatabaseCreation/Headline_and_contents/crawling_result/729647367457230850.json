It's not that anyone necessarily is trying to hide the fact that a mistake was made. It's that \"medical error\" isn't even an option on death certificates.And that, Dr. Martin Makary says, is a mistake. While tripping on ventilator cords rarely happens in the United States, medical errors are plentiful, according to a new analysis by Makary, a cancer surgeon and professor of health policy and management at the\u00a0Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Michael Daniel, a Hopkins medical student.Makary and Daniel cite several definitions of medical error from the scientific literature:They\u00a0estimate that more than a quarter of a million U.S. hospital patients die each year as a result of a medical error, making it the third leading cause of death, behind only heart disease and cancer. But, Makary told me, \"in generating our national health statistics, these problems are not even showing up.\"Makary and Daniel's estimate is far higher than the 44,000 to 98,000 annual hospital deaths from medical errors estimated in a 1999 report\u00a0by\u00a0the Institute of Medicine (IOM). But it's lower than the more than 400,000 deaths estimated in a 2013 article\u00a0by John James, \u00a0a Texas man who created Patient Safety America after, he says, his 19-year-old son died in 2002 \"as a result of uninformed, careless and unethical care by cardiologists at a hospital.\"A new analysis concludes that deaths from medical errors are under-counted because the CDC doesn't... [+] recognize that category on death certificates. (Photo: Shutterstock)In their paper, published in the BMJ, formerly the British Medical Journal, Makary and Daniel call the IOM estimate \"limited and outdated.\" In an email to me, James noted that Makary and Daniel based their estimate on three of the four studies he had used but used \"different assumptions to arrive at a substantially different number. In the text of that paper, the authors admit that many errors are going to go uncounted with their approach. I dealt with those uncertainties in my paper, although, as you well know, exact counts are elusive at this point.\"Pretty much everyone who's studied medical errors would agree with James' last observation. The problem, Makary and Daniel conclude in their paper, is that in the United States, as in 116 other countries, death certificates rely on assigning an International Classification of Disease (ICD) code to the cause of death. The first ICD codes were developed more than a century ago. You've likely seen them on paperwork at your doctor's office, which uses ICD codes in medical records and reimbursement claims.\"The system that we have now is not designed for today,\" Makary told me. \"Billing codes were never meant for national health statistics. People just don't die of billing codes. People just don't die of bacteria and hardened arteries.\" They die from communication breakdowns and diagnostic errors as well, causes that are not an option on death certificates, he said.Makary and Daniel and two other Hopkins medical students wrote\u00a0an appeal Sunday to CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden, urging that the agency change the way it collects death statistics.\"The list of most common causes of death published is very important--it informs our country's research and public health priorities each year,\" they wrote. \"The current methodology used to generate the list has what we believe to be a serious limitation. As a result, the list has neglected to identify the third leading cause of death in the U.S.--medical error. The limitation stems from a historic policy that says death certificates can only be tabulated with an ICD billing code.\"The CDC should allow physicians to list medical error as the cause of death, they wrote, \"and in the interim, the CDC should list medical error as the third most common cause of death in the U.S.\" Currently, that spot is held by\u00a0\"chronic lower respiratory diseases,\" the most deadly of which is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, which kill 149,205 Americans annually.James says he agrees that doctors should be able to check \"medical error\" on death certificates. \"In fact, I would have a parallel box to declare that the medical records have been examined and there is no evidence of a medical error,\" he said. \"The signer would have to check one or the other box.\"Makary says his estimate of 252,454 deaths annually due to medical errors underestimates the number of Americans who die as a result of medical errors, because it includes only hospital deaths. \"It does not count deaths at home due to human error,\" he said. \"There are a lot of deaths it does not capture.\"Are physicians equipped to determine that medical error caused a patient's death? Makary said some skeptics have told him, \"Well, you need to do a formal autopsy, a formal investigation, to make that conclusion.\" But he disagrees, noting that physicians make similar judgments every day, such as whether a patient who comes in with shortness of breath has pneumonia or congestive heart failure.Although doctors might be equipped to call out a medical error, whether they'll actually do it is another matter. \"We need to insure legal protections so doctors can report accurately without repercussions,\" Makary said.\u00a0\"We're always going to be human. We're always going to make errors.\"But without documentation, he said, it's as though the problem of medical errors doesn't exist.\"Many of the victims (of medical errors) are either no long alive or victims of an egregious medical practice who settled with hospitals, are gagged and never speak about the problem,\" he said. \"This is really a silent epidemic.\""}
