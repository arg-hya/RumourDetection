His other credits include \"Charlie's Angels,\" ''Dynasty\" and \"Baywatch.\" His wife said injuries sustained on the set of a Western film ended his career in 1997.A smoker since age 14, Lawson later appeared in an anti-smoking commercial that parodied the Marlboro man and an \"Entertainment Tonight\" segment to discuss the negative effects of smoking.
