On Friday, Mann found out that her stepdaughter, Maree Rizk, was killed along with 297 others on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which U.S. intelligence authorities believe was shot down by a surface-to-air missile.\u201cIt\u2019s just brought everyone, everything back,\u201d said Greg Burrows, Mann\u2019s brother. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2026 ripped our guts again.\u201dRead full storyReports that perhaps as many as 100 HIV researchers were on board the downed flight heading to a conference in Australia have shaken the entire profession. Among them was one of the most renowned, Joep Lange.See full stories here and here.Kuala Lampur, Malaysia\u2013Malaysia\u2019s Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai faced repeated questions at a press briefing in Kuala Lumpur today about whether the route that the airline had chosen to fly over rebel-controlled areas of Ukraine was safe.Other airlines such as Qantas had stopped flying those areas, but the minister said that more than a dozen other Asian Pacific airlines had continued to fly it and it was approved by the International Air Transport Association. He said that the plane had not sent a distress call and its systems were in good working order before the deadly crash.Annie GowenEmergency workers at the scene of the crash. (Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters)Under normal circumstances, among the first people to swarm a plane crash site on land are trained professionals. Even under the best of conditions, they\u2019re painstakingly methodical: they seal off the site to prevent tampering, videotape, \u00a0examine, preserve parts of the wreckage to be sent off in bits and pieces for analysis. They never know which part of a wing or fuselage might tell the tale, so every small find is crucial.But the circumstances of Thursday\u2019s Malaysia Airlines plane crash were\u00a0anything but normal. It was obvious from the moment a\u00a0giant explosion sounded in the distance in eastern Ukraine, spawning smoke that billowed black across the horizon. Among the first to arrive on the scene weren\u2019t \u201cfirst-responders,\u201d or \u00a0clipboard-carrying inspectors, nor professionals trained to deal with such emergencies. They were off-duty coal miners rooting around among the wreck, according to news reports.Terrence McCoyRead the full story here.The Associated Press is reporting that Ukraine rebels claim to have \u201cmost\u201d of the data recording devices from the Malaysia Airlines plane that crashed yesterday.Russian news agencies and Reuters were reporting the same thing.The devices could prove critical in determining what happened to the aircraft. There was no word on what the rebels-if indeed they do have the devices-plan on doing with them.Malaysia Airlines is trying to arrange safe access for relatives of victims to the site in eastern Ukraine where its Boeing 777 airliner crashed killing all 298 on board, a spokeswoman for Amsterdam airport said on Friday, according to Reuters.\u201cThe relatives, a few hundred of them, are currently being housed in a hotel at Schiphol,\u201d the spokeswoman said. On Thursday, the airline\u2019s European head said it was sending a Boeing 747 to Amsterdam to take relatives to the Ukrainian capital Kiev.Andriy Purgin, a self-proclaimed leader among the Donetsk rebels in Ukraine, told the Russian news agency Interfax Friday morning that separatists are ready to call a truce for two to four days in order to allow Boeing officials and international experts to have unhampered access to the plane crash site.Purgin also told Interfax that rebels would be meeting Friday to discuss that truce with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Ukrainian government.Karoun DemirjianSeparatists have told the OSCE that they will close off the crash site and permit safe access to it for international investigators.In an announcement on its website, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said it had held a video conference with separatists in Donetsk and had been assured that they would provide \u201csafe access and security guarantees\u201d for both national and international crash investigators.The organization also said separatists had committed to closing off the site in preparation for the recovery of bodies.Members of the HIV research community are reeling from the news that many of their own, including world-renowned AIDS researcher Joep Lange, perished when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down Thursday over Eastern Ukraine.The victims were on their way to the International AIDS Conference that begins this weekend in Melbourne, Australia, a trip halfway around the world that necessitated a change of planes in Kuala Lumpur.Joel Achenbach and Ariana ChaSee the full story. The White House expressed concern last night about access for international investigators to the site where Malayasian Airlines Flight 17 went down, saying it is \u201cvital that no evidence be tampered with.\u201dIn a statement issued at 10:38 in Washington, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the U.S. was reaching out to member-states of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) with the idea of getting them involved quickly in the investigation.Here\u2019s the full statement:The United States is shocked by the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, and we offer our deep condolences to all those who lost loved ones on board.\u00a0 We continue to seek information to determine whether there were any American citizens on board.It is critical that there be a full, credible, and unimpeded international investigation as quickly as possible.\u00a0 We urge all concerned \u2013 Russia, the pro-Russian separatists, and Ukraine \u2013 to support an immediate cease-fire in order to ensure safe and unfettered access to the crash site for international investigators and in order to facilitate the recovery of remains. The role of international organizations \u2013 such as the United Nations and the OSCE in Ukraine \u2013 may be particularly relevant for this effort, and we will be in touch with affected nations and our partners in these organizations in the coming hours and days to determine the best path forward.\u00a0 In the meantime, it is vital that no evidence be tampered with in any way and that all potential evidence and remains at the crash site are undisturbed.\u00a0 The United States remains prepared to contribute immediate assistance to any international investigation, including through resources provided by the NTSB and the FBI.While we do not yet have all the facts, we do know that this incident occurred in the context of a crisis in Ukraine that is fueled by Russian support for the separatists, including through arms, materiel, and training.\u00a0 This incident only highlights the urgency with which we continue to urge Russia to immediately take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine and to support a sustainable cease-fire and path toward peace that the Ukrainian government has consistently put forward.Secretary of State John Kerry says the State Department is still reviewing whether any American citizens were on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH 17. Here\u2019s his statement:We are horrified by the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.\u00a0 There are no words adequate to express our condolences to the families of the nearly 300 victims.\u00a0 We offer our sympathies and support to the governments of Malaysia and the Netherlands at this difficult time, as well as to all those whose citizens may have been on board.\u00a0 We are reviewing whether any American citizens were aboard the flight.\u00a0 The United States Government remains prepared to assist with a credible, international investigation any way we can, and we will continue to be in touch with all relevant partners as we seek the facts of what happened today.Chinese relatives of long-missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 passengers said in a joint statement that Thursday\u2019s crash resurfaced many the questions and feelings they have struggled with since MH370\u2032s disappearance in March. In a statement posted on Weibo, the MH370 Relatives Committee said some people who lost family members on the March flight were watching TV coverage of the MH17 crash \u201cand couldn\u2019t stop crying.\u201d \u201cWe have to ask, where is the flight safety? Will every plane ride become scary like a roller-coaster?\u201dNoting the abundance of \u201cdifferent and confusing information about MH17,\u201d the statement continued: \u201cIt\u2019s as if the tragedy of MH 370 is happening all over again. We hope relevant countries could work together instead of undermining each other; we hope there would be consistent instead of contradicting information.\u201dMany Weibo users said when they saw \u201cMalaysia Airlines\u201d trending online, they thought MH370 had been found. Instead, many posters asked: Why Malaysia Airlines again? Some online users said that they hoped the incident would bring back  attention for MH370.\u2013 William WanThe\u00a0Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice on Thursday night prohibiting any U.S. flight operations in the airspace over eastern Ukraine until further notice.This restriction, which was issued in response to the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet, expands an earlier FAA order prohibiting U.S. flights from operating over certain areas in Ukraine. That prohibition was issued in April and said\u00a0U.S. flights could not\u00a0operate in the airspace over the Crimean region and near the Black Sea \u201cdue to the continuing potential for instability.\u201dThe April\u00a0notice did not cover the airspace where the Malaysia Air flight was shot down.The wreckage of the crashed jet. (Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters)In the hours after a Malaysia Airlines plane crashed in eastern Ukraine, the only thing immediately clear was that nearly 300 people had died.\u00a0Beyond that, there was confusion, as groups and officials began making claims and counterclaims, accusations and rebuttals, with no unequivocal answers as to who was responsible for shooting down the Boeing 777.The arguments began almost immediately,\u00a0as the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatist rebels in Ukraine quickly blamed each other for the crashing of Flight 17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. But as comments were posted on social media sites and taken down, and as audio recordings were produced and fingers pointed,\u00a0things only became more and more murky.U.S. intelligence officials confirmed Thursday that the plane was taken down by a surface-to-air missile. But analysts were still scrambling to determine who actually fired the missile.An official with the Ukrainian government quickly claimed that pro-Russian rebels used a missile system to shoot down the plane.\u00a0Anton Herashenko,\u00a0adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, wrote on Facebook that a Buk anti-aircraft missile system \u2014 which he said was provided to the rebels by Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 shot down the plane in an area held by pro-Russian rebels.Like Herashenko, Putin, in televised remarks, also\u00a0blamed the rebels for the crash. But they denied responsibility and blamed\u00a0the Ukrainian government, arguing that they lacked the capabilities to shoot down a commercial airliner.\u201cThe plane was shot down by the Ukrainian side,\u201d said Serhiy Kavtaradze, a member of the rebels\u2019 security council, according to Interfax. \u201cWe simply do not have such air defense systems.\u201dKavtaradze said the rebels have shoulder-launched anti-aircraft\u00a0missiles with \u201ca firing range of only 3,000 to 4,000 meters\u201d \u2014 about 10,000 to 13,000 feet \u2014 and that passenger jets fly at much higher altitudes.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko denied that the government shot down the plane, saying that Ukraine\u2019s armed forces \u201cdid not take action against any airborne targets,\u201d according to the Associated Press.While rebels in eastern Ukraine denied having the rocket launcher needed for such an attack, journalists with the Associated Press had reported seeing a similar weapon in this region earlier in the day. The Buk missile system is capable of reaching\u00a0a plane expected to be flying between 33,000 and 37,000 feet.And in\u00a0a conversation between President Obama and Putin on Thursday morning discussing recent U.S. sanctions against Russia,\u00a0Obama noted \u201cextensive evidence that Russia is significantly increasing the provision of heavy weapons to separatists in Ukraine,\u201d the White House said in a statement.Adding to the confusion, the Ukraine Security Service later released a recording of what it claimed were intercepted phone calls capturing\u00a0pro-Russian separatists discussing shooting down a plane. The Washington Post could not independently verify the recording or any of the individuals on it. (Three Russian language speakers working for The Washington Post have verified the English translation used here.)The recording appears to be a composite of three separate conversations; at one point, a voice on the recording identified by the Ukrainian intelligence agency says either \u201cwe have just shot down a plane\u201d or \u201cthey have just downed the plane.\u201d In another portion of the recording, one voice describes seeing \u201clots of corpses of women and children\u201d on the ground.\u201cThey say on TV it\u2019s an AN-26 transport plane, but they say it\u2019s written Malaysia Airlines on the plane,\u201d the voice said. \u201cWhat was it doing on Ukraine\u2019s territory?\u201dAnother posting that appeared to comment on the plane appeared\u00a0on a social media site before being shot down.\u00a0Not long\u00a0after the plane went down, a social media\u00a0page frequently attributed in Ukrainian media to Igor Girkin, a Russian citizen who describes himself as a rebel military leader, seemed to post\u00a0something that appeared to claim responsibility for the downed plane.\u201cWe have just shot down an AN-26 plane in the Torez region, it is lying somewhere near the Progress mine,\u201d read the post at 5:50 p.m. Moscow time on the social media site VKontakte. \u201cWe have warned emphatically: Do not fly in \u2018our sky.\u2019\u201dThe Washington Post has not confirmed that the posting was created by Girkin or someone associated with the rebels. The post, which appeared to suggest that the pro-Russian forces thought the aircraft was a Ukrainian military transport plane,\u00a0claimed\u00a0to offer\u00a0\u201cvideo confirmation\u201d of the crash. However, after news emerged that the downed plane was a commercial airliner, the post was removed.Ukrainian officials also said that two other planes were shot down earlier in the week: A Ukrainian air force jet, which they said was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a Russian plane on Wednesday; and a military transport plane, which they said was shot down Monday by a missile fired from Russian territory.World leaders and politicians quickly reacted to the crash, offering condolences and assistance, but some reactions were muddled based on the confusion. Sen. John McCain (R) told reporters Thursday afternoon that \u201cthe culpable party here is Putin,\u201d though he admitted that his comments were based solely on news reports, which at the time were inconclusive and lacking many details.This confusion is likely to linger, because any investigation is expected to\u00a0be complicated by the fighting in the region. A Ukrainian regional official said after the crash that rebels did not allow the government access to the plane for the first hour, while Russian officials are insisting\u00a0that they have a right to be included in any investigation of the crash. And pro-Russian separatists told Interfax they had found \u201cblack box\u201d flight recorders at the crash scene, saying later that they planned to give them to officials in Moscow.Meanwhile,\u00a0the plane was filled with Dutch, Malaysian, Australian and Indonesian citizens, among others, which meant that the crash\u00a0transcended the Ukrainian-Russian border and touched countries around the world. So in addition to Russian officials wanting to be part of the investigation, other countries could also insist on being part of the efforts to understand\u00a0the crash.Karoun Demirjian and Natasha Abbakumova in Moscow and Abby Phillip, Isabelle Khurshudyan and Kirill Kozionov in Washington contributed to this report.RELATED: Flights are avoiding the airspace over Ukraine.Members of the international HIV research community who are heading to Melbourne for a huge International AIDS Conference beginning this weekend are in a state of shock and grief after hearing reports that a prominent European researcher and at least several other delegates perished when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down Thursday over eastern Ukraine.\u201cThe International AIDS Society (IAS) today expresses its sincere sadness at receiving news that a number of colleagues and friends en route to attend the 20th International AIDS Conference taking place in Melbourne, Australia, were on board the Malaysian Airlines MH17 flight that has crashed over Ukraine earlier today,\u201d conference officials said in a statement. \u201cAt this incredibly sad and sensitive time the IAS stands with our international family and sends condolences to the loved ones of those who have been lost to this tragedy.\u201dThe identities of the victims have not been confirmed by the airlines.\u201cThere are Australians who would have planned to be at the airport tomorrow night to greet friends and family \u00e2\u0080\u0094 amongst them, some of the world\u2019s leading AIDS experts,\u201d Australian opposition leader Bill Shorten told Parliament Friday morning, according to the Associated Press. \u201cThe cost of this will be felt in many parts of the world.\u201dFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton is to deliver an address at next week\u2019s AIDS conference, which brings together thousands of scientists and activists from around the world to discuss the latest developments in HIV and AIDS research.House of Representatives Speaker Bronwyn Bishop called for a moment of silence in parliament to honor the victims, adding that she was scheduled to address the AIDS conference on Monday.\u201cI know there will be many empty spots,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cAnd I think that what we\u2019re doing is mourning with all of the world and all that had been lost. And we want to see justice but in a measured way.\u201dOne delegate described the group that had already gathered in Australia as being devastated. About 14,000 delegates are expected at the conference.AIDS research has been marked by previous aviation disasters. Irving Sigal, a molecular biologist who helped develop the drugs used to treat HIV, died in the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. Ten years later, prominent researchers Jonathan Mann and Mary Lou Clements-Mann died in the crash of Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia.\u2013 Joel AchenbachThere were 298 people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 when it was shot down Thursday, not 295 as the airline originally said.In announcing the new number in a statement, the airline said there were three infants on the plane:As opposed to the earlier statement, the flight was carrying a total number of 298 people \u2013 comprising 283 passengers including three infants of various nationalities and 15 crew of Malaysian nationality. Some of the nationalities of the passengers are yet to be determined.The airline said in the statement that all of its European flights \u201cwill be taking alternative routes avoiding the usual route\u201d \u2014 though, it added, Flight 17\u2032s usual route \u201cwas earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. International Air Transportation Association has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions.\u201dIn its statement, the airlines also released details about the nationalities of most of the passengers and crew members who were aboard Flight 17.Ukraine\u2019s intelligence service claimed Thursday that it intercepted a\u00a0recording\u00a0of several separatists and a Russian military intelligence officer conferring about the Malaysia Airlines plane that was shot down.The recording \u2014 an apparent composite of three separate conversations \u2014 was broadcast on Russian radio station Ekho Moskvi and published online by the Kyiv Post and also on the Ukrainian Security Service\u2019s website and YouTube page.The Washington Post could not independently verify the recording or the individuals identified in it. However, three Russian language speakers working for The Washington Post independently verified the English translation used here.One voice on the tape \u2014 identified by the Ukrainian intelligence agency as Igor Bezler, one of the leaders in the pro-Russian separatist movement in eastern Ukraine \u2014 says either \u201cwe have just shot down a plane\u201d or \u201cthey have just down the plane.\u201d (This Russian statement could be translated in either way in the context of this conversation.)The middle portion of the video is a conversation between two different people described as \u201cterrorist\u201d [sic] in the English subtitles produced by the Ukrainian intelligence agency. They discuss the downing of the plane, saying it was shot down by a group of insurgents, referred to as \u201cCossacks,\u201d who were located near the Chernukhin checkpoint, which is 15 miles north of the crash site, according to the Associated Press.\u201cWell, what do you have there?\u201d says a\u00a0person, identified in the Security Service video as \u201cGreek.\u201d\u201cIn short, it was 100 percent a passenger aircraft,\u201d answers another voice, calling from the crash scene and identified in the video as \u201cMajor.\u201dLater in the video, in a separate conversation, a militant describes the scene at the crash site:\u201cThere are lots of corpses of women and children.\u00a0The Cossacks are out there looking at all this\u2026 They say on TV it\u2019s an AN-26 transport plane, but they say it\u2019s written Malaysia Airlines on the plane. What was it doing on Ukraine\u2019s territory?\u201dKaroun Demirjian and Natasha Abbakumova in Moscow and Isabelle Khurshudyan and Kirill Kozionov in Washington contributed to this report.President Obama spoke with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Thursday to discuss the Malaysian Airlines plane crash. Obama \u201cassured him that U.S. experts will offer all possible assistance immediately,\u201d according to the White House, which said Poroshenko \u201cwelcomed the assistance.\u201dHead to Post Politics for more."}
