You\u2019ve hit a child!\u201d the BMW\u2019s driver paused, then switched into reverse and backed up over the girl.The woman at the wheel drove forward once more, crushing the girl for a third time.When she finally got out from the BMW, the unlicensed driver immediately offered the horrified family a deal: \u201cDon\u2019t say that I was driving the car,\u201d she said. \u201cSay it was my husband. We can give you money.\u201dIt seems like a crazy urban legend: In China, drivers who have injured pedestrians will sometimes then try to kill them. And yet not only is it true \u2014 it\u2019s fairly common; security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. The Chinese language even has an adage for the phenomenon: \u201cIt is better to hit to kill than to hit and injure.\u201dThis 2008 television report features security-camera footage of a dusty white Passat reversing at high speed and smashing into a 64-year-old grandmother.The Passat\u2019s back wheels bounce up over her head and body. The driver, Zhao Xiao Cheng, stops the car for a moment then hits the gas, causing his front wheels to roll over the woman.Incredibly, Zhao was found not guilty of intentional homicide. Accepting Zhao\u2019s claim that he thought he was driving over a trash bag, the court of Taizhou in Zhejiang province sentenced him to just three years in prison for \u201cnegligence.\u201d Zhao\u2019s case was unusual only in that it was caught on video. As the television anchor noted, \u201cYou can see online an endless stream of stories talking about cases similar to this one.\u201d\u201cDouble-hit cases\u201d have been around for decades. I first heard of the \u201chit-to-kill\u201d phenomenon in Taiwan in the mid-1990s when I was working there as an English teacher. A fellow teacher would drive us to classes. After one near miss of a motorcyclist, he said, \u201cIf I hit someone, I\u2019ll hit him again and make sure he\u2019s dead.\u201dEnjoying my shock, he explained that in Taiwan, if you cripple a man, you pay for the injured person\u2019s care for a lifetime. But if you kill the person, you \u201conly have to pay once, like a burial fee.\u201d He insisted he was serious \u2014\u00a0and that this was common.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                A policeman stops traffic for people to cross the main Nathan Road after the site was occupied by pro-democracy protesters for weeks, at Mongkok shopping district in Hong Kong, November 26, 2014.\n                              \n\n                                  Reuters\n                                \n\nMost people agree that the hit-to-kill phenomenon stems at least in part from perverse laws on victim compensation. In China, the compensation for killing a victim in a traffic accident is relatively small \u2014 amounts typically range from $30,000 to $50,000 \u2014\u00a0and once payment is made, the matter is over. By contrast, paying for lifetime care for a disabled survivor can run into the millions. The Chinese press recently described how one disabled man received about $400,000 for the first 23 years of his care. Drivers who decide to hit-and-kill do so because killing is far more economical. Indeed, Zhao Xiao Cheng \u2014\u00a0the man caught on a security-camera video driving over a grandmother five times \u2014 ended up paying only about $70,000 in compensation.The man\u2019s foot is so close to the toddler\u2019s head that, if alive, the boy could have reached out and touched him. The driver then puts the BMW in drive again, running over the boy one last time as he drives away.Here too, the driver was charged only with accidentally causing a person\u2019s death. (He claimed to have confused the boy with a cardboard box or trash bag.) Police rejected charges of murder and even of fleeing the scene of the crime, ignoring the fact that the driver ran over the boy\u2019s head as he sped away.Perhaps the most horrific of these hit-to-kill cases are the ones in which the initial collision didn\u2019t injure the victim seriously, and yet the driver came back and killed the victim anyway. In Sichuan province, an enormous, dirt-encrusted truck knocked down a 2-year-old boy. The toddler was only dazed by the initial blow, and immediately climbed to his feet. Eyewitnesses said that the boy went to fetch his umbrella, which had been thrown across the street by the impact, when the truck reversed and crushed him, this time killing him.Despite the eyewitness testimony, the county chief of police declared that the truck had never reversed, never hit the boy a second time, and that the wheels never rolled over the child. Meanwhile, one outraged website posted photographs appearing to show the child\u2019s body under the truck\u2019s front wheel.With so many hit-to-kill drivers escaping serious punishment, the Chinese public has sometimes taken matters into its own hands. In 2013 a crowd in Zhengzhou in Henan province beat a wealthy driver who killed a 6-year-old after allegedly running him over twice. (A television report claims the crowd had acted on \u201cfalse rumors.\u201d However, at least five witnesses assert on camera that the man had run over the child a second time.)Of course, not every hit-to-kill driver escapes serious punishment. A man named Yao Jiaxin who in 2010 hit a bicyclist in Xian and returned to make sure she was dead \u2014\u00a0even stabbing the injured woman with a knife \u2014 was convicted and executed. In 2014 a driver named Zhang Qingda who had hit an elderly man in Jiayu Pass in Gansu province with his pickup truck and circled around to crush the man again was sentenced to 15 years in prison.Both China and Taiwan have passed laws attempting to eradicate hit-to-kill cases. Taiwan\u2019s legislature reformed Article 6 of its Civil Code, which had long restricted the ability to bring civil lawsuits on behalf of others (such as a person killed in a traffic accident).Hit-to-kill cases continue, and hit-to-kill drivers regularly escape serious punishment. In January, a woman was caught on video repeatedly driving over an old man who had slipped in the snow. In April, a school-bus driver in Shuangcheng was accused of driving over a 5-year-old girl again and again. In May, a security camera filmed a truck driver running over a young boy four times; the driver claimed that he had never noticed the child.And last month the unlicensed woman who had killed the 2-year-old in the fruit market with her BMW \u2014 and then offered to bribe the family \u2014 was brought to court. She claimed the killing was an accident. Prosecutors accepted her assertion, and recommended that the court reduce her sentence to two to four years in prison.This light sentence would still be more of a punishment than many drivers have received for similar crimes. But it probably won\u2019t be enough to keep the next driver from putting his car in reverse and hitting the gas."}
