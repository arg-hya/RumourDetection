As these policies proliferate across the country, the number of stories of predators threatening women and children in public restrooms is also growing by the day.The Target department store chain drew the ire of millions of Americans after it announced\u00a0it was opening its bathrooms to transgender shoppers and employees and allowing them to choose whatever bathroom they feel like using at any given time.Days later a #BoycottTarget petition effort launched that drew over 200,000 signatures in a day and over 300,000 by the weekend.The current imbroglio should not be a surprise, as for years Target has been a big purveyor and supporter of gay-friendly policies and causes. So, this current bathroom policy issue is not the first time the chain waded into left-wing issues.On its corporate website, for instance, there are many posts and announcements celebrating the LGBT lifestyle.Furthermore, last year, Target was a corporate sponsor of the \u201cOut & Equal\u201d conference, a summit aimed at forcing corporations into adopting gay-friendly workplace policies.The company was also praised by gay groups for its \u201cIt Gets Better\u201d campaign meant to boost the status of homosexuality in the U.S.In addition, Target raised the ire of many with its decision to re-engineer its kids\u2019 sections, when in August of 2015 the chain announced it was eliminating \u201cgender specific\u201d labels and store signage for kids\u2019 clothing and toy sections.The radical homosexual agenda is not the only liberal issue Target has taken on. Two years ago\u00a0the company demanded that customers \u201cnot bring firearms\u201d into stores, despite legal concealed-carry laws saying gun owners may do so.The company also has a long list of political causes and candidates it has donated to over the years.Still, in defense of such polices, liberals ask what harm could come to anyone if bathrooms are opened up to men dressed as women, or others who claim to be transgender? On the other hand,\u00a0those who reject these policies ask why the nation should put women and children in danger by allowing predators to more easily enter and install video cameras in bathrooms and changing rooms or otherwise threaten and harass people using the restroom?Target itself has had incidents of predators threatening children in its bathrooms. Only weeks ago such an incident occurred in a Cedar Park, Texas store.But there are dozens of such stories over the last 16 months or so\u00a0highlighting the problem with setting policies that would make access to public restrooms easier for predators.First up are five incidents in which\u00a0predatory men were discovered committing\u00a0criminal actions in public restrooms. Some of these men were arrested while dressed as women; others claimed to be transgender women.Man in women\u2019s locker room cites gender ruleSeattle Parks and Recreation is facing a first-of-a-kind challenge to gender bathroom rules.
