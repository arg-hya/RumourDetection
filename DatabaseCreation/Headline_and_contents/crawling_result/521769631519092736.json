Ahmed asserted that the (graphic) photos, which were later obtained and posted online by the Middle East Review of International Affairs journal, suggest the fighters had died as a result of exposure to chemical toxins.While it still remains unclear whether chemical agents were actually used by the Islamic State, Israeli experts who examined the photographs said the wounds, which included severe peeling of the skin and heavy blistering, suggested the Kurdish fighters had been exposed to mustard gas, the GLORIA Center reported. The experts added, however, that more data was needed to form a definitive conclusion.In early July, shortly before the attack on Kobani, officials in Iraq reported that the Islamic State had taken control of a vast former chemical weapons facility northwest of Baghdad, where 2,500 chemical rockets filled with the deadly nerve agent sarin, or their remnants, were stored along with other chemical warfare agents.Iraq\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations,\u00a0Mohamed Ali Alhakim, said in a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that \u201carmed terrorist groups\u201d entered the Muthanna site on June 11, detained officers and soldiers from the protection force guarding the facility and seized their weapons. The following morning, the project manager spotted the looting of some equipment through the camera surveillance system before the \u201cterrorists\u201d disabled it, he said.Alhakim singled out the capture of Bunkers 13 and 41 in the sprawling complex 35 miles (56 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad.The UN, however, stressed that the bunkers were bombed during the first Gulf War in February 1991, which routed Iraq from Kuwait, and said the rockets were \u201cpartially destroyed or damaged.\u201dThe UN added that the sarin munitions were \u201cof poor quality\u201d and \u201cwould largely be degraded after years of storage under the conditions existing there.\u201d It said the tabun-filled containers were all treated with a decontamination solution and likely no longer contain any agent, but \u201cthe residue of this decontamination would contain cyanides, which would still be a hazard.\u201dAccording to the report, Bunker 41 contained 2,000 empty 155-mm artillery shells contaminated with the chemical warfare agent mustard gas, 605 one-ton mustard containers with residues, and heavily contaminated construction material. It said the shells could contain mustard residues, which can\u2019t be used for chemical warfare but \u201cremain highly toxic.\u201dThe Syrian Kurdish enclave of Kobani has been the scene of heavy fighting since late last month, with the better-armed Islamic State fighters determined to capture the border post.The extremist group has carved out a vast swath\u00a0of territory from northern Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad and imposed a harsh version of Islamic rule. The fighters have massacred hundreds of captured Iraqi and Syrian soldiers, terrorized religious minorities, and beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers.A US-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes against militant targets in and around Kobani for more than two weeks, and the town\u2019s fate has emerged as a major test of whether the air campaign can obstruct\u00a0the advance of the extremists in Syria.Adiv Sterman and AP contributed to this report.As The Times of Israel's environment reporter, I try to convey the facts and science behind climate change and environmental degradation, to explain - and critique - the official policies affecting our future, and to describe Israeli technologies that can form part of the solution.I am passionate about the natural world and disheartened by the dismal lack of awareness to environmental issues shown by most of the public and politicians in Israel.I'm proud to be doing my part to keep Times of Israel readers properly informed about this vital subject - which can and does effect policy change.Your support, through membership in The Times of Israel Community, enables us to continue our important work.
