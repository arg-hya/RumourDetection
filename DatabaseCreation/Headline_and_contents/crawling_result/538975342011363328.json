The grand jury\u2019s decision set off protests and riots in Ferguson and many other U.S. cities. Demonstrators called for justice in the killing of Brown and criticized the police and prosecutors for how they investigated and tried the case.During the interview, which was conducted by ABC host George Stephanopoulos, Wilson gave his account of the events that took place before he killed Brown. Most of what Wilson told ABC was already covered in his testimony before the grand jury. When asked by Stephanopoulos if there was anything he could have done differently, Wilson said \u201cNo.\u201dABC and Stephanopoulos have been criticized for not challenging Wilson\u2019s account of the incident. People took to Twitter to express their dislike of the interview.So do we. The past year has been the most arduous of our lives.
