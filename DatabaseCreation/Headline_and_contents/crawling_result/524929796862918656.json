Nathan Cirillo of Hamilton, Ont., is the second member of the Armed Forces this week to die in an apparently random, murderous attack, just as Canadian war planes are being deployed to Iraq.\n\tTwo Canadian soldiers were run over -- one of them fatally -- in Quebec on Monday by a man with jihadist sympathies.\n\tThe slain shooter was identified as Michael Zehaf Bibeau, born in 1982 and known to police in Montreal and Vancouver.\n\t\"It's way too early to be able to determine a motive,\" Gilles Michaud, the assistant commissioner of the RCMP, said at a news conference in Ottawa while police were still clearing downtown buildings.\n\tBut the prime minister, who was in the Centre Block addressing a Conservative caucus meeting when the attack began just outside the door, later took to the national airwaves to unequivocally characterize the shooter's true motives.\n\t\"Fellow Canadians, in the days to come we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had,\" Harper said.\n\t\"But this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.\"\n\tAttacks on Canadian security personnel and governing institutions, he said, are \"by their very nature, attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.\"\n\tTony Zobl, 35, witnessed Cirillo being gunned down at the War Memorial from his fourth-floor office window directly above the monument, just before 10 a.m. Wednesday.\n\t\"I looked out the window and saw a shooter -- a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well -- holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph, point blank, twice,\" Zobl told The Canadian Press.\n\t\"It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun,\" he continued. \"The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.\"\n\tZobl said the shooter then ran up the street toward Parliament Hill.\n\tIt was only earlier this year that the government extended the season for live guards at the monument through the November Remembrance Day ceremonies. In the past, the honour guard has stood down after Labour Day.\n\tThe scene on Parliament Hill was frantic.\n\tWednesday morning is the busiest day of the week on the Hill, with MPs and senators of all major parties gathering in the Centre Block for meetings.\n\tGiven the time and day, it was remarkable only four persons were admitted to hospital. One was Cirillo, and the other three were all released Wednesday evening. Only one had a minor gunshot wound.\n\tWitnesses and video suggest a hail of gunfire erupted in the marbled Hall of Honour that bisects the building directly beneath the Peace Tower.\n\tKevin Vickers, better known to political wonks as the ceremonially garbed sergeant-at-arms carrying the mace to open the Commons each day, was reported by multiple sources as the person who shot the gunman.\n\tConstruction worker Scott Walsh said he was in a manhole near the East Block building, between the memorial and the Centre Block, when he heard two gunshots echo down the street.\n\tIn the ensuing panic, people around him started screaming, including a woman pushing a child in a stroller.\n\tHe said she started to run, so he went to help her.\n\tThat's when he saw a man with long black hair, his face covered by a white scarf with decals on it and wearing a black jacket.\n\t\"He had a double-barrelled shotgun, he was about five feet from me, and he ran right beside us, ran past the woman with the stroller and child,\" he said.\n\tThe gunman then hijacked a car at gunpoint, he said, and drove it up towards the Peace Tower.\n\tGreta Levy, a press secretary for the NDP, said she had just left the building when she saw the gunman walk up the paved ramp under the tower.\n\t\"None of us reacted at first but then we heard a security guard yelling, 'There's a gun, get down, get down, there's a gun,\"' Levy said.\n\t\"And I looked up, as did the woman I was with, and saw a man that I would describe as young, 20s-30s, coming up the ramp as though to go in the main doors of Centre Block under the Peace Tower.\"\n\tThe incident paralyzed the entire downtown core for hours, from the adjacent U.S. embassy to the University of Ottawa several city blocks to the south.\n\tSources say police at one point worried there could be up to five assailants, and they combed rooftops of nearby buildings in addition to the full lockdown.\n\tThe incident shattered the sleepy tenor of a capital that has been remarkably immune from attack through more than a decade of tumultuous overseas wars.\n\t\"I feared this day would come, and my prayers are with the fallen soldier,\" senior cabinet minister Tony Clement posted on Twitter while locked in the caucus room. \"Hug your fam.\"\n\t\"It's a stomach-turning, shocking day for all Canadians,\" Marc Garneau, a former Forces member and now Liberal foreign affairs critic, said in an interview.\n\tThe Hill is known as an open public space that's used for everything from mass yoga classes to hazy pot-legalization demonstrations.\n\t\"I think the intention was to try to make Parliament not look like Fort Knox,\" said Garneau. \"But we've crossed a river today.\"\n\tGreen party Leader Elizabeth May urged restraint.\n\t\"Today is not a day that 'changes everything,\"' May said in a statement. \"It is a day of tragedy. We must ensure we keep our responses proportionate to whatever threat remains.\"\n\tMilitary bases have been put on alert and soldiers have been cautioned about wearing uniforms in public.\n\tIn Toronto, the country's largest city, extra police where put on the streets and public buildings were on alert.\n\tJan Lugtenborg, a tourist from the Netherlands, was at the War Memorial and able to describe the shooter in detail.\n\t\"We heard four shots,\" said Lugtenborg.\n\t\"You don't expect that when you're on holiday in Canada.\"\n- With files from Jennifer Ditchburn, Steve Rennie, Jim Bronskill, Murray Brewster, Stephanie Levitz, Joan Bryden, Andy Blatchford and Lina Dib. \nPHOTO GALLERY\nThe sun sets on Parliament Hill as seen across the river from Ottawa, in Gatineau, Que., after a fatal shooting in Ottawa on Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2014.
