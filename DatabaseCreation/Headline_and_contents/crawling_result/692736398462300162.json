Any ideas?While Super Bowl ticket prices are quite high -- they aren't 2,100-square-feet, three-bedroom, two-bath high.Aside from the obvious pricing discrepancy -- and the fact that Lusk has no intention of selling his house -- the ad claims the owner is \"getting divorced: leaving her with nothing.\" Lusk's wife confirms he is not getting divorced.The gauntlet has been thrown. Your move, Brian . . .(H/T 9News) "}
