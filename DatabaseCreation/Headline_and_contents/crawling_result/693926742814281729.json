And tulips are especially popular.So, when photographer George Steinmetz was offered a ride over the country\u2019s largest fields, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing aerial photos for a long time,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cI had a friend in Holland who saw that I was in Stuttgart, Germany, for an exhibition, and he said, \u2018You should come to Amsterdam, I\u2019m going to fly over fields of tulips, if you want a ride in a helicopter.\u2019 It was an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201dSitting in the front seat, Steinmetz felt like an aerial paparazzo, he says: \u201cWhen you\u2019re that low in the sky, it\u2019s kind of like street photography. It\u2019s kind of instinctive. If you think too much, you screw things up.\u201dIn fact, he adds, \u201cit\u2019s good not to have too many rules when you go up. You just want to look around. Generally for that subject matter it\u2019s nice to have people to give a sense of scale and activity. Otherwise, you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re looking at a close up of a carpet or a sweater. You try to look for patterns. The best way to shoot this, I think, is with a telephoto lens. You go up and you respond to what you\u2019re seeing.\u201dIn the end, Steinmetz is the first to admit that his images are \u201cchroma-porn,\u201d he says. \u201cThe colors are so bright, and that kind of thing works very well on Instagram.\u201dGeorge Steinmetz is an independent photographer and a frequent contributor to National Geographic and GEO.Olivier Laurent is the editor of TIME LightBox.
