Bannon an update on AFA\u2019s Target Boycott efforts, which has now gathered\u00a0over a million signatures.\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible,\u201d Rios said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had quite an outpouring. We have right now 1,137,000 families who signed on to the boycott.\u201d\u201cTarget stocks are dropping. They started dropping the day we announced this boycott,\u201d said Rios. She and Bannon discussed reports that Target has lost as much as $2 billion in market capitalization as a result of the current decline.According to additional reports\u00a0Target had lost as much as\u00a0$2.5 billion dollars in stock value during this period given their Friday numbers.Target stock prices dropped in 10 days after the retailer announced a new policy to allow customers to use whichever bathroom or fitting room accords to their gender identity.On Friday, the shares of Target Corporation Common Stock (TGT) fell 2.52 percent in one day, according to recent reports. In addition since April 19th, the day they announced the new policy, the stock went from a share value of $84.14 to $79.27 per share. That\u2019s a drop of 5.8 percent in 10 days.The Family Policy institute says they estimate that to be a loss to the company of $2.5 billion dollars.\u201cTarget\u2019s response is that they are standing by their policy. They want everyone to feel welcome, and their solution is that if women are uncomfortable with men coming into their bathrooms, they should use the family bathroom. So, rather than the 0.3 percent of the population that claim the transgender status, they want the women to use the family bathroom,\u201d she added.Continued Rios, \u201cThe chief concern, even more than the trauma for little girls of having men dressed like women coming in their bathrooms, the chief concern of the American Family Association is the predators who will take advantage \u2026 and we have a long list of predators who have done that.\u201d\u201cThis is not going to stop with Target if we don\u2019t take a very strong stand now,\u201d Rios said. \u201cI would say on the positive side, we\u2019ve had other corporations come to us privately and say they\u2019re watching. They were considering changing their policies, but they\u2019re watching this boycott and they\u2019re saying, you know, maybe not. Maybe we\u2019re not going to go in that direction. So, a lot hinges on it, and this is something simple that people can do.\u00a0We are in dialogue with other companies, other corporations encouraging them not to do this. And of course if they do, we\u2019ll have to apply the same thing that we applied to Target,\u201d she concluded.Rios also noted:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know if people realize that the Obama Education Department has been pushing this whole thing of breaking down the barriers in the bathrooms in public school now this whole year. They are actually threatening to withhold money from schools if schools do not accommodate children, boys and girls who think they are the other gender \u2026 that they can lost their funding. So, this has been a battle by school boards. There\u2019s a huge one that went on in fairfax, Virginia, just this past year and they lost. The parents lost.\u201dBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST.Listen to his full interview on Breitbart News Daily below:\nPoliticsRadio#BoycottTargetTargetTarget bathroom policy.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Protect Yourself From Big Tech!Thank You!Copyright \u00a9 2021 Breitbart"}
