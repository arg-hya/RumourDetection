The shooting suspect has been identified as 32-year-old Michael Zehaf-Bibeau from Quebec.Twitter/Kamakazi19982Megan Underwood, via FacebookAFPAPAPAPAPAPAPGetty ImagesPAReutersAPEPAEPAReutersEric TwittyGerry ByrneMike KujawskiReacting to the image on Twitter, users called it \"touching\" and thanked MacKinnon for \"capturing the spirit of a nation\".Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
