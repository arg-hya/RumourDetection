A woman in Tampa, Florida recently underwent surgery to give herself a third breast. Of course Florida. Of course.Going by the name of Jasmine Tridevil (Tri\u2014get it?), she went under the knife to give herself a center breast in order in the hopes of obtaining reality star fame.\u00a0Tridevil is trying to pitch her story to MTV with the plan to secure a reality show and, according to her Facebook\u00a0page,\u00a0is currently filming \"her daily life in Tampa to show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.\" Didn't she learn from other people who have tried to find fame via outrageous surgeries? And did she even give any thought to how expensive customizing all her bras is going to be?Tridevil\u00a0noted that the surgery cost $20,000 and included a \u201cnipple\u201d implant. She had to ask over 50 doctors to do the procedure, and when she finally found one, she was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement so he couldn't be named in public.Related StoriesSTORY CONTINUES BELOWAside from the public recognition, she claims she underwent the surgery because she \"wanted to make [her]self unattractive to men,\" and was uninterested in dating.We doubt she'll have to worry about that problem anymore.UPDATE:\u00a0\nJasmine Tridevil\u00a0appeared on a local news broadcast last night, and showed off her surgical enhancement. She briefly lifted up her shirt, to which the Tampa-based reporter creepily asked her to repeat and hold up longer. Tridevil said she'd rather not, and said,\u00a0\"I don't feel comfortable doing that because\u00a0that's also going\u00a0to be on my show.\"\u00a0While people have definitely been known to get outrageous surgical procedures\u00a0to modify their bodies, Tridevil definitely took it to another level, and various Internet detectives are saying that this could be an elaborate bid for reality fame that is ultimately just another hoax.
