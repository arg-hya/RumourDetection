Something else happened just report the truth next time, it would be far more believable if you have just said they were involved along with local security forces in a gunbattle against the Taliban, even though that is hard to believe in it\u2019s own rights, that only the Taliban had suffered casualties.I believe this story because the average woman is at least 10 times as smart as your average goat raping Talibani savage. It does not take much to outwit them. You can usually tell they are coming by the sound of their knuckles dragging on the ground when they walk.Hell hath NO fury like a Mother robbed of her child!!! I believe it,, and I believe she doesn\u2019t give a rats tail that she meets with retaliation from the Taliban! Remember, a lot of these Taliban fighters are goof balls with a gun\u2026doesn\u2019t matter, she\u2019s lost what was most precious to her, right in front of her eyes and she will die going down in revenge.This is a fake news to promote the unstability of the countryYou must be dumb to think that a woman in afghanistan could not be angry enough to accomplish this. Most of the Taliban and \u201cmullahs\u201d with guns are dumb as rocks. Im sure a child with half a brain and a gun could kill more Taliban before anything happening.Something is off with this report, where was she fighting from? A bunker? armed to the teeth with RPGs and Rocket a launchers, maybe tripwires? Where were all the other townsfolk during the Taliban assault, so you want us to believe that this woman fighting for her life in some fortified bunker somewhere, lobbing grenades and rpg fire and reloading and firing all by herself manage to kill 25 Talibans over 7 hours of battle? What were the Talibans armed with? Pitchforks??She had done a good job perhaps. Hope it would be a good lesson for Taliban and inspiration for other Afghan women to fight for themselves and for their country.\u00a0Nice Job! She should get the award of bravest woman of the world not the porkistani malalaiRez a Gul, what a name\u00a0No way this happened.Stupid raghead propaganda trick.what are they showing by announcing and publishing such a fake news? it should be improved and some part of this news may be right not all of that. when she starting the fighting against taliban for 7 hours where were the security army and police? were they asleep or just watching the film shouting sense that they handed over job to a women? however we proud on our people women and men and on their braveness and such creativity on one hand and on the other hand if this is right and just a women carried out all this serious job and the other security forces just watching that what happing, this is crime they should asked and call for investigation.That\u2019s bad, now the Taliban will take revenge. Cut her head offYou guys thinking, tHat this is fake news right?\nWhy is that fake? can\u2019t a woman do that? Can\u2019t she do that for her son and her Land?\nYou guys should watch her interview,\nsHe used bomb and some other guns which they had it at home coz her son \u201dwas\u201d police and her husband \u201dis\u201d and yeah there are guns in every Afghan house.Very good shooting ladies. Keep it up, Please!keep killing them goodluck from india..I hope Afghanistan can get to some level of harmony, and this violence stops.\u00a0The educated elite(which can read this) and the urban resistance can\u2019t even comprehend each other. It\u2019s like they speak different languages, even though both are Afghans.WHOOOOOOOOO!!! GO GIRL! even thou im a boy :3 KICK THEIR BUTS LIK A BAWS WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!Im curious why people are suggesting this is fake news??? If i was a woman stuck under Taliban regime in Afghanistan and they killed my children I would absolutely do the same and achieve it. Also, let\u2019s not forget how uneducated the Taliban are\u2026.I would imagine its very easy to outsmart and outcall them. More women should do the same\u2013especially after Farkhunda\u2019s public murder.Bravo! I\u2019m proud of you mother. No one deserves courage but the fair and the good.I don\u2019t care if this brave woman had killed 25 Talibans. Even if she had killed at least one Taliban, I am greatly proud of her. All that matters is that she avenged her son\u2019s death, That\u2019s it.\nI think she didn\u2019t do this alone. She had three other people \u2013 her daughter and daughter-in-law \u2013 helping her.\nI am not sure if this is fake news. There must be some amount of truth in it.\nAfghanistan needs hundreds of brave woman warrior like this. Every Afghan woman has to stand up to fight for her right. Otherwise, Afghanistan will fail as a nation, just like Porkistan.\nLong live Afghanistan! May Allah bless you all!India salutes brave sisters of Afghanistan.\u0632\u0647 \u062f \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0647 \u062f \u0648\u0644\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u067e\u0647 \u0686\u0648\u06a9\u0627\u067c \u06a9\u06d0 \u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0648 \u062f\u0627 \u06cc\u0648\u0647 \u062c\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0631\u0627\u067e\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0648 \u0628\u0646\u0633\u067c \u067e\u0647 \u063a\u0644\u0637\u0648 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0648\u060c \u062f \u062f\u06d0 \u0646\u0647 \u067e\u06d0\u069a \u0634\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0696 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0644\u062a\u0647 \u062f \u067e\u0647 \u0627\u0693\u0647 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u06d0\u062f\u0644\u064a \u062f\u064a.I am within the Farah Province and this is a fabricated report and based on false pretense , this did not happen we would of heard about it here.Your email address will not be published.
