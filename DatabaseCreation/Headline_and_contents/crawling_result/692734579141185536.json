{"id": "692734579141185536", "headline": "Rest In Hell, Java Plug-In", "content": "Good news from the world of online security: Oracle, developer of the Java plugin that has been making browsers insecure since 1995, has finally announced that it\u2019s sending it six feet under. The Java plugin isn\u2019t dead immediately: it will be deprecated in the next release of the Java Developer Kit, which is a fancier way of saying Oracle will sweep it under the rug, and encourage people not to use it. The functionality will be \u201cfully removed\u201d in some later release, once everyone\u2019s said their final farewells. It\u2019s a move that is entirely logical, and really too late. Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge have all either killed support for plugins, or announced that they\u2019re going to do so in the near future, leaving no room to support the Java plugin. More importantly, Java is a terrible blight on our computer security that must be stopped at all costs. Everyone from independent developers to the Department of Homeland Security have shit on Java for opening up access to a billion computers thanks to zero-day programming bugs. So long, Java; we won\u2019t miss you. [Oracle]Can someone give this memo to the US Patent Office? They still have a filing system that requires Java, and don't seem interested in changing it. It may literally be impossible to file patent applications online soon. "}
