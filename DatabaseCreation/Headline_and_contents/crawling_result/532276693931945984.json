Rest in peace, Big Bank.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThirty-five years later, there still remains some debate as to whether the timeless, 14-minute rhyme spree was technically the first recorded hip-hop song; and controversy still shadows it, as the Sugarhill Gang were mostly New Jersey interlopers borrowing directly from Bronx-born Grandmaster Caz\u2019s rhyme book. But there is no question that the vivid, hilarious tales of dinnertime manners and cuckolded superheroes of \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d was suburbia America\u2019s first experience with the nascent culture. It reportedly sold millions upon millions of copies, though Sugar Hill Records, notoriously close to their own accounting, never had it officially certified.Jackson\u00a0had lived in the Bronx during hip-hop\u2019s inception, attending high school with pioneers like Kool Herc and Coke La Rock and briefly having a managerial role with Caz himself. By 1979, rap music had spent a half-decade as live-performance party music, powered by street lights and youthful energy. However, it had never made it to vinyl until record producer Sylvia Robinson and her son Joey recruited Hank from an Englewood, New Jersey pizza parlor, where he was saving up money after getting a degree in oceanography from Bronx Community College.Covered in pizza dough, he auditioned in the back of Joey\u2019s Oldsmobile 98, causing enough commotion to bring both Master Gee and Wonder Mike over. A late night cipher in Sylvia Robinson\u2019s home on a Friday night formed a group that started recording that Monday. The session, little more than a take or two of the three men rapping over the studio band playing Chic\u2019s \u201cGood Times,\u201d made music history almost instantly.\u201cI mean one minute you\u2019re walking down the street,\u201d Hank said in the book Yes Yes Y\u2019all, \u201cThe next minute you\u2019ve got bodyguards and being chased down the street.\u201dThough the \u201chotel, motel\u201d rhyme was originally floating in the hip-hop atmosphere from Coke La Rock, Hank\u2019s impassioned performance of it on \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d marked its first appearance on wax. It\u2019s ultimately been transmuted, via American folk tradition, into a Number Three hit for Chingy (\u201cHolidae In\u201d), a Number Eight hit for Pitbull (\u201cHotel Room Service\u201d) and bars for everyone from Wu-Tang Clan and 50 Cent to De La Soul and TLC. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sugarhill Gang had their share of success throughout the early Eighties with 1980\u2019s giddy \u201c8th Wonder\u201d and 1981\u2019s crowd-starting \u201cApache,\u201d still a staple of sporting events the world over. But once Run-D.M.C.\u2019s drum-machine-pummel and shouted delivery exploded in 1983, their disco-inflected sound instantly became dated. The 2011 documentary I Want My Name Back alleges that the Robinsons wouldn\u2019t let the crew evolve with the times.Since they originally disbanded in 1985, Jackson\u00a0had been estranged from the other two members of the group. He\u00a0continued using the Sugarhill Gang name alongside Joey Robinson performing as \u201cMaster Gee.\u201d This iteration performed at the 2004 BET Awards, the inaugural VH-1 Hip-Hop Honors and Justin Timberlake\u2019s Old School Jam in 2011. Though Wonder Mike himself performed with this version for 11 years, the Robinson-led Sugarhill Gang ultimately invoked years of legal wrangling.But no matter who was on stage, the music of the Sugarhill Gang remained musical bedrock. \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d made\u00a0a memorable appearance in the 1998 film The Wedding Singer and was turned into a high-energy single by Spanish quirk-pop trio Las Ketchup that\u00a0went Number One in more than 20 countries. Hank\u2019s cry of \u201cWoo-Hah! Got them all in check\u201d also became a hit chorus for Busta Rhymes in 1996.\u201cI see groups that are hot one minute and next time you see them they\u2019re asking if you want a soda with that Happy Meal,\u201d Hank told Maryland\u2019s Herald-Mail in 2013. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the ability to transcend generations and that\u2019s a gift. That\u2019s a blessing and I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201d\n\t\tIn This Article:\n\t\t\t\tSugarhill Gang \n\t\t\tWant more Rolling Stone?
