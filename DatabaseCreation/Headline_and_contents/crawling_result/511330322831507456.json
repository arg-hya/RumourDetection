Despite her plea for mercy, the group murdered her son one week later.The claim that the government would bring charges against the Sotloff family echoes similar\u00a0points made in a CNN interview with Jim Foley's mother Diane, in which she said she was \"embarrassed and appalled\" by the US government's handling of her son's case.In the interview, Diane Foley listed things the US government advised the family not to do, including not going to the media and not to raise a ransom since it would be illegal \u2014 \"we might be prosecuted,\" Foley said she was told. She also says the government told her it would not exchange prisoners or conduct a military action to go after him.\"We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,\" she said. \"And he wasn't, was he?\"Jim Foley, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost in Syria, was brutally murdered in mid-August soon after the US began airstrikes against ISIS militants in Iraq.\"It just made me realize that these people talking to us had no idea what it was like to be the family of someone abducted ... \" Diane Foley told ABC News. \"I\u2019m sure [the US official] didn\u2019t mean it the way he said it, but we were between a rock and a hard place. We were told we could do nothing \u2026 meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day.\u201dThe US military attempted a rescue operation in July to find Foley, Sotloff, and other hostages believed to be held near ISIS' de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, although the special operations\u00a0troops were unable to locate any of them.\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0the hostages were likely moved as little as 72 hours prior to the raid."}
