Activists demanding free elections for\u00a0the semi-autonomous territory have been holding their hands up in the air in a symbol of non-violent protest, a gesture many in the US recognize from\u00a0recent protests in\u00a0Ferguson, Missouri\u00a0after an unarmed 18-year-old was shot to death by police.Most Hong Kong protesters aren\u2019t purposefully\u00a0mimicking\u00a0\u201dhands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201das some have suggested. Instead, the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful\u00a0intentions to police.Asked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson, Icy Ng, a 22-year-old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands.\u201d Ng\u00a0had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator, Ellie Ng, 24, said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to\u00a0demonstrate\u00a0that \u201cHong Kong protesters are peaceful, unarmed, and mild.\u201d (A more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella, which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas.)Still, the gesture has taken on new meaning for Hong Kong residents whose relationship with the city\u2019s police may never be the same. Hong Kong is one of the most intensively policed cities in the world, with a police force of 30,000 that rivals New York City\u2019s but serves\u00a0a fraction of New York\u2019s population.\u00a0The last time Hong Kong authorities\u00a0used tear gas against demonstrators was in\u00a02005, during demonstrations outside of\u00a0a World Trade Organization meeting, and in 1967, when leftist activists rioted throughout the city.Now, residents are shocked by images of students being tear gassed and\u00a0elderly demonstrators being pepper sprayed in the face, footage that has prompted more protesters to join demonstrations on Monday.
