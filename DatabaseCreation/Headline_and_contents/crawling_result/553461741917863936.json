France is continuing to mourn for the Charlie Hebdo victims, as well as four of the hostages killed during Friday's supermarket siege. You can follow further updates, as well as background material on the story, on the BBC News website.Perhaps France's best-know cartoonist has shown his solidarity too.

The shop shutters open slowly to reveal a body lying as police quickly approach the entrance.  They fire into the building. The shot is frozen when a man dressed in black - possibly the hostage taker - appears running towards the door.  Dozens of police enter the supermarket and hostages run onto the street.

Official video from AQAP praises, but does not claim.Police were able to identify Coulibaly's DNA from a cloth found near the scene of the deadly attack on a policewoman in Montrouge on Thursday. He was identified within two hours. It is likely four of the hostages were killed when the gunman entered the Jewish supermarket, and not during the special police operation that ended the siege. The gunman had called a TV station to say that he had killed four of the hostages. Coulibaly and his girlfriend, Hayat Boumeddiene, spoke more than 500 times to the Kouachi brothers over the phone.Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, speaking at a conference, says that an employee at the printing works where the Kouachi brothers were in Dammartin-en-Goele, was hiding on the second floor underneath a sink.

She thought they may be extremists so her husband broke in with the help of a plumber and discovered a cache of weapons. The brothers caught them, and forced them to promise not to tell the police.\"According to French media, police were able to monitor what was happening inside the supermarket when the gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, failed to hang up properly after speaking to them. The BFMTV news channel says this was what enabled the police to hear what was going on in the background, as they heard the hostage taker saying a prayer. Forensic experts are still investigating the hostage site at the Jewish supermarket as night-time draws in.It is still not clear whether the supermarket gunman, 32-year-old Amedy Coulibaly, had an accomplice or not. Police had earlier issued an appeal saying they were looking for Coulibaly and a 26-year-old woman called Hayat Boumeddiene after both were suspected of involvement in the fatal shooting of a policewoman in a southern Paris suburb on Thursday. Police are still actively searching for Ms Boumeddiene, whose whereabouts remain unknown. Several old photos of the two have been published on Le Monde's website, some of which show them both firing a small crossbow.
