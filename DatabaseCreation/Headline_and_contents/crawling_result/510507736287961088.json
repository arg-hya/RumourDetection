We were told we could do nothing\u2026 meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day.\u201dEarlier this week five current and former officials with direct knowledge of the Foley case confirmed the alleged threats were made.\"It was an utterly idiotic thing to do that came across as if [the U.S. official] had the compassion of an anvil,\" said a former official who has advised the family.Digital Feature: Inside Terrorist Hostage NegotiationsCould Money Have Saved James Foley?Video Appears to Show Beheading of US Journalist James FoleyDiane Foley told ABC News earlier this week that warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff. James Foley\u2019s brother, Michael, also told ABC News that he was directly threatened with possible prosecution by a State Department official.\u201cIt was very upsetting because we were essentially told to trust\u2026 that the way they were handling things would bring our son home,\u201d Diane Foley said.The U.S. government did try to rescue James Foley along with other American and European hostages from an ISIS stronghold in Syria in early July, but by the time the elite commandos arrived at the location, the hostages had been moved. Foley was executed weeks later by a self-professed ISIS militant.Diane Foley said the family believed they knew where their son was being held prior to his execution, but other than the July rescue mission, it didn\u2019t seem like anything was being done.\u201cBut we\u2019re not politicians, we\u2019re not government people, we don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. Diane Foley said the problem was that the family \u201chad no idea\u201d because the government didn\u2019t tell them.At times, Diane Foley said the family \u201chad to beg\u201d the government for information on their son.\u201cWe were an annoyance, it felt, at some level\u2026 They didn\u2019t have time for us,\u201d she said.Today White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that government officials were in constant contact with the Foley family and declined to comment on the alleged ransom warnings, telling reporters he\u2019s \u201cnot going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family.\u201d\u201cIt is a long standing policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations,\u201d Earnest said before referring more specific questions about the Foley\u2019s situation to the Justice Department.Secretary of State John Kerry today told reporters that he was \u201creally taken aback [and] surprised\u201d by Foley\u2019s allegations.\u201cI can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements,\u201d Kerry said.State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today denied the State Department told the family they could be prosecuted for paying ransom, only that the department helps hostage families \u201cunderstand what our laws are about terrorists or paying ransom to terrorists.\u201d\u201cBut this department would never and did not ever intend nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening,\u201d Harf said.Thursday an NSC spokeswoman also said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied the family was told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment.\"Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,\" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.The spokeswoman also asked ABC News to withhold the military officer's name for fear his personal security could be compromised by those who might wrongly blame U.S. officials for Foley's slaughter at the hands of ISIS militants who may never have considered sparing him for any price.Diane Foley did not disclose how much her family had raised before his high-profile public execution but she and a surviving son, Michael, said that the administration's intimidation tactics succeeded.\"It slowed my parents down quite a bit. They didn't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. It slowed them down for months in raising money. Who knows what might have happened?\" Michael Foley said.The family launched the James W. Foley Legacy Fund this week, which in large part is intended to help other hostages' loved ones navigate the frustrating currents they encountered both with the terrorists and with their own government.Two American and several British hostages remain in ISIS captivity.Asked whether she had believed ISIS would accept a ransom payment and free their son, as they had many European hostages liberated for between $2-3 million each, Diane Foley replied, \"I do, maybe -- I mean, who knows?\"\"ISIS is a very brutal group. They may have already decided, that Jim and the others were Americans and they were going to kill him,\" Diane Foley said.In the end, Diane Foley said she didn't want to blame anyone for what happened to her son, but said that when it comes to the U.S. government\u2019s treatment of the families of hostages, \u201cAs Americans, we can do better.\u201dCLICK HERE to return to the ABC News Investigative Unit homepage.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}
