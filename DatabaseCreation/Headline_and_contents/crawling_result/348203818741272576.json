In fact, according to a TIGTA audit report published last year, four of the top ten addresses to which the IRS sent thousands of tax refunds to \u201cunauthorized\u201d aliens were in Atlanta.The IRS sent 11,284 refunds worth a combined $2,164,976 to unauthorized alien workers at a second Atlanta address; 3,608 worth $2,691,448 to a third; and 2,386 worth $1,232,943 to a fourth.Other locations on the IG\u2019s Top Ten list for singular addresses that were theoretically used simultaneously by thousands of unauthorized alien workers, included an address in Oxnard, Calif, where the IRS sent 2,507 refunds worth $10,395,874; an address in Raleigh, North Carolina, where the IRS sent 2,408 refunds worth $7,284,212; an address in Phoenix, Ariz., where the IRS sent 2,047 refunds worth $5,558,608; an address in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., where the IRS sent 1,972 refunds worth $2,256,302; an address in San Jose, Calif., where the IRS sent 1,942 refunds worth $5,091,027; and an address in Arvin, Calif., where the IRS sent 1,846 refunds worth $3,298,877.Since 1996, the IRS has issued what it calls Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) to two classes of persons: 1) non-resident aliens who have a tax liability in the United States, and 2) aliens living in the United States who are \u201cnot authorized to work in the United States.\u201dThe IRS has long known it was giving these numbers to illegal aliens, and thus facilitating their ability to work illegally in the United States. For example, the Treasury Inspector General\u2019s Semiannual Report to Congress published on Oct. 29, 1999\u2014nearly fourteen years ago\u2014specifically drew attention to this problem.\u201cThe IRS issues Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) to undocumented aliens to improve nonresident alien compliance with tax laws. This IRS practice seems counter-productive to the Immigration and Naturalization Service\u2019s (INS) mission to identify undocumented aliens and prevent unlawful alien entry,\u201d TIGTA warned in that long-ago report.The inspector general\u2019s 2012 audit report on the IRS\u2019s handling of ITINs was spurred by two IRS employees who went to members of Congress \"alleging that IRS management was requiring employees to assign Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN) even when the applications were fraudulent.\u201dIn an August 2012 press release accompanying the audit report, TIGTA said the report \u201cvalidated\u201d the complaints of the IRS employees.\u201cTIGTA\u2019s audit found that IRS management has not established adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the assignment of an ITIN to individuals submitting questionable applications,\u201d said Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George. \u201cEven more troubling, TIGTA found an environment which discourages employees from detecting fraudulent applications.\u201dIn addition to the 23,994 tax refunds worth a combined $46,378,040 that the IRS sent to a single address in Atlanta, the IG also discovered that the IRS had assigned 15,796 ITINs to unauthorized aliens who presumably used a single Atlanta address.The IRS, according to TIGTA, also assigned ITINs to 15,028 unauthorized aliens presumably using a single address in Dallas, Texas, and 10,356 to unauthorized aliens presumably living at a single address in Atlantic City, N.J.Perhaps the most remarkable act of the IRS was this: It assigned 6,411 ITINs to unauthorized aliens presumably using a single address in Morganton, North Carolina. According to the 2010 Census, there were only 16,681 people in Morganton. So, for the IRS to have been correct in issuing 6,411 ITINS to unauthorized aliens at a single address in Morganton it would have meant that 38 percent of the town\u2019s total population were unauthorized alien workers using a single address.TIGTA said there were 154 addresses around the country that appeared on 1,000 or more ITIN applications made to the IRS.Copyright 1998-2021 CNSNews.com.CNSNews.com is a division of the Media Research Center.The mission of the Media Research Center is to\n                    create a media culture in America where truth and liberty flourish.
