During the discussion, co-host Anna Kooiman claimed that while the memorial is closed, \u201cPresident Obama has offered to pay out of his own pocket for the museum of Muslim culture.\u201dKOOIMAN: The Republican National Committee is offering to pay for it to keep it open so that the veterans from Honor Flight are going to be able to go and see this because who did it honor? It honored them. It really doesn't seem fair, especially -- and we're going to talk a little bit later in the show too about some things that are continuing to be funded. And President Obama has offered to pay out of his own pocket for the museum of Muslim culture out of his own pocket, yet it's the Republican National Committee who's paying for this.\u00a0Unfortunately for Kooiman, the claim\u00a0that Obama offered to pay out of pocket for a \u201cmuseum of Muslim culture\u201d originated from the\u00a0satirical website the National Report. As the\u00a0fact-checking\u00a0site Snopes.com\u00a0points out, a now-removed\u00a0disclaimer\u00a0on the National Report noted: \u201cNational Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news.\u201dFox has a\u00a0history\u00a0of\u00a0passing off satirical stories as actual news.\u00a0UPDATE:\u00a0On October 6, Kooiman issued the following\u00a0statement\u00a0via Twitter: \u201cJust met w producers- I made a mistake yday after receiving flawed research abt a museum possibly closing. My apologies. Won't happen again.\u201dUPDATE 2: The Associated Press reported that, according to a spokeswoman, Fox will issue an on-air correction Saturday, October 12:Fox will correct the mistake on the air this Saturday, spokeswoman Dana Klinghoffer said. Fox's policy is to correct mistakes on the same show where they are made.UPDATE 3:\u00a0Kooiman issued an on-air\u00a0correction\u00a0during the October 12 broadcast of\u00a0Fox & Friends\u00a0Saturday,\u00a0apologizing for making a \u201cbad mistake\u201d reporting a story that was \u201cnot true\u201d:I wanted to get to this this morning -- last weekend we mentioned a story about the president funding a Muslim museum during the shutdown. We made a bad mistake by reporting a story based on poor research that was not true. We apologize for not checking the facts and for allowing the story to make air.\n\n\nVideo & Audio\n\n\n\n08/13/21 11:21 AM EDT\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n\n08/13/21 10:31 AM EDT\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n\n08/13/21 10:02 AM EDT\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n\n08/13/21 8:29 AM EDT\n\n\n\nVideo & Audio\n\n\n\n08/12/21 10:46 PM EDT\n\n\n\nVideo & Audio\n\n\n\n08/11/21 10:10 AM EDT\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n\n08/06/21 4:01 PM EDT\n\n\n\nVideo & Audio\n\n\n\n08/06/21 10:12 AM EDT\n\u00a9 2021 Media Matters for America"}
