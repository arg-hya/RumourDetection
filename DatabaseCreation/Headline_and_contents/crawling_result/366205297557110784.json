TEPCO also said\n  it plans to boost the pumped-out amount to some 100 tons a day\n  with the help of a special system, which will be completed by\n  mid-August. This will be enough to seal off most of the ongoing\n  ocean contamination, according to TEPCO\u2019s estimates.\n\n  However, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Industry has recently estimated that some 300 tons of contaminated\n  groundwater have been flowing into the ocean daily ever since the\n  March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that triggered the\n  disaster.\u00a0\n\n  TEPCO also promised it will urgently reinforce the protective\n  shields to keep radioactive leaks at bay. The company has\n  repeatedly complained it is running out of space and has had to\n  resort to pumping water into hastily-built tanks of questionable\n  reliability, as more than 20,000 tons of water with high\n  levels of radioactive substances has accumulated in the plant\u2019s\n  drainage system.\u00a0\n\n  Water samples recently taken at an underground passage below the\n  Fukushima nuclear plant showed extreme levels of radiation comparable\n  to those taken immediately after the March 2011 catastrophe. The\n  tested water, which had been mixing with ground water and flowing\n  into the ocean, contained 2.35 billion Becquerels of cesium per\n  liter \u2013 some 16 million times above the limit.\n  RT News App\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132021.
