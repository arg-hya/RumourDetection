The artist published a series of photographs of the\u00a0new work on his website,\u00a0without commenting on\u00a0the fake\u00a0story about his arrest and outing as a mid-aged British man named\u00a0Paul Horner.On Tuesday an unknown vandal splattered part of the mural in black paintPhoto: ITV News West CountryOn Monday a story\u00a0published on the satirical American news\u00a0website National Report\u00a0claimed that London\u2019s Metropolitan\u00a0Police had arrested the artist on charges of \u201cvandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting.\u201d The false arrest reports that his studio had been\u00a0raided by Police turned out to be recycled story from a previous hoax.The Girl with the Pierced Eardrum (2014) follows Banksy\u2019s recent pieces\u00a0Art Buff (2014), in Folkestone, England, which was vandalized only weeks after appearing (see \u201cPhallic Addition to Folkestone Banksy Mural\u201c), and Birds of a Feather\u00a0(2014) which was removed by the local government who deemed it to be racist (see \u201cImmigration-Themed Banksy Mural Destroyed by Local Council\u201c).It is the second time this year the artist has graced his hometown of Bristol with a Banksy original. Shortly after Mobile Lovers\u00a0was unveiled on Banksy\u2019s website, it was controversially snatched by the leader of a local youth\u00a0club hoping to keep his struggling organization afloat (see \u201cYouth Club Removes New Banksy with Crowbar\u201c). The artist later gave the club his blessing, and it was sold to benefit the group (see \u201cBanksy Gives Controversial Mobile Lovers Artwork to Bristol Youth Club\u201d and \u201cSale of Banksy\u2019s Mobile Lovers for $670,000 Saves Youth Club\u201c).Share\n\t\t\tBy\n\t\t\t,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOct 22, 2014\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tBy\n\t\t\t,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOct 22, 2014\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u00a92021 Artnet Worldwide Corporation.
