That the album finally materialized on Wednesday night, a little more than three years after Rihanna\u2019s last album,\u00a0Unapologetic, still seems almost impossible.\u00a0Rihanna released a smattering of singles last year, none of which appear on Anti; of those songs, the circuitous \u201cAmerican Oxygen\u201d is probably the closest to this album sonically. On this album, Rihanna\u2019s focus is turned inward \u2014 toward herself and lovers who consistently disappoint her by not showing up, both emotionally and physically. Anti\u2018s equivalent of a \u201cbanger\u201d is probably the first single, \u201cWork,\u201d released Wednesday morning. Rihanna lolls about over a spare beat (courtesy of Partynextdoor and Boi-1da), alternating regretful asides about loneliness with bedroom-related demands; Drake shows up to briefly act semi-sensitive, then (wisely) cedes the floor to his hostess/fixation. There\u2019s also \u201cWoo,\u201d a grinding-gears track full of barely enunciated spite that\u2019ll probably inspire quite a few scream-alongs on its defiant \u201cI don\u2019t even really care about you no more\u201d chorus. (Rumored paramour Travi$ Scott offers up a theremin impersonation and a couple of \u201cyeahs.\u201d) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRihanna Surprise-Releases Eighth Album, 'Anti'\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRelated\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Private Lives of Liza Minnelli (The Rainbow Ends Here)\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBlack Sabbath on the Making of 'Vol. 4': 'It Was Absolute Pandemonium'\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nBut for the most part, Anti is brooding and at times claustrophobic, made for those lonely stretched-out moments in the aftermath of highs and thrills. An austere Timbaland beat anchors the exhausted come-on \u201cYeah I Said It\u201d; \u201cKiss It Better\u201d is a gorgeously juicy slow jam that calls out to a departed lover over a thick guitar solo; the downcast \u201cDesperado\u201d turns Rihanna into a reluctant Lone Ranger, searching for someone to accompany her as she rides around a blasted-to-bits landscape. A gauzy, yet faithful cover of \u201cNew Person, Same Old Mistakes\u201d by the Australian indie-psych outfit Tame Impala \u2014 called \u201cSame Ol\u2019 Mistakes,\u201d with production credited to Tame Impala mastermind Kevin Parker \u2014 opens with cymbal hits that fleetingly bring to mind the opening of Rihanna\u2019s 2007 megahit \u201cUmbrella,\u201d although the song that follows trips through lovelorn doubt in ways far removed from that brashly confident track.The end of Anti plays out like the tail end of a night, when last-call bravado fades into something more thoughtful. \u201cLove on the Brain\u201d is rooted in buttoned-down music that sounds plucked from a mid-20th-century prom band\u2019s slow-dance repertoire, although the imagery Rihanna uses to describe love \u2014 \u201cfist-fighting with fire just to get close to you,\u201d \u201cit beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good\u201d \u2014 hints at something more desperate. \u201cHigher,\u201d meanwhile, is a brief drunk-dial (\u201cThis whiskey got me feelin\u2019 pretty/So pardon if I\u2019m impolite,\u201d Rihanna wails at its outset) that cuts off just as she\u2019s about to launch into a more detailed description of her wanting. \u201cClose to You\u201d winds Anti down, Rihanna subdued and wistful over a tinkling piano, hesitantly beckoning toward a reluctant other. \u00a0\u00a0Much of Rihanna\u2019s pop-cultural appeal \u2014 the fuel for the GIFs, the retweets, the excitable blog posts \u2014 comes from the way she seemingly exists on her own terms. The longer-than-usual gestation period for Anti was an extension of that pay-no-mind attitude, a change-up from the brutal album-of-bangers-a-year strategy that helped her exercise domination over the charts. Anti is particularly striking in this context; the \u201cRihanna\u201d on this album is alone and yearning\u00a0for more. That she\u2019s finding too-brief highs provided by drugs, sex and seemingly having it all instead of something more lasting is so exhausting that she can\u2019t not care \u2014 and Anti serves as a sometimes-frustrating, often-fascinating documentation of that all-encompassing weariness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tIn This Article:\n\t\t\t\tRihanna \n\t\t\tWant more Rolling Stone?
