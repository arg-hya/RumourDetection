A study of the 2010 census data suggests that only about 1 in 2,400 adults change their names to match names used by the other sex.Wildmon\u2019s association wants to affirm people\u2019s privacy in bathrooms and changing rooms, but also to block the progressives\u2019 multi-front push to stigmatize and outlaw any recognition of the average differences between women and men, and between boys and girls. The LGBT\u00a0agenda \u201cis being rammed down people\u2019s throats, and people are losing their jobs because of it, and it is becoming\u00a0so that you can\u2019t think differently from these people or you\u2019re [called] a hater or a bigot,\u201d he said.\u00a0Since the decision was announced, numerous comments, articles, and videos protesting the store\u2019s one-sided decision have gone viral. Public opinion has moved and hardened in opposition to the previously bizarre notion of dual-sex bathrooms and changing rooms, and Target\u2019s brand as a family friendly store has taken a hit, as the online conversation shifted from its claim of \u201ccheap chic\u201d to worries of privacy, sexual predators, and the anger at the company\u2019s disregard for the reasoned judgement of its middle-class customers.\u201cThis is how people can fight back \u2014 they\u2019re not going to shop at Target,\u201d said Wildmon.\u00a0The I Pledge to Boycott @Target Stores petition has 1,000,911 Signers as of 10:14 PM 4/28/16 eastern time!! #BoycottTarget OVER ONE MILLION!\u2014 Silver Fox  (@SilverFoxOO7) April 29, 2016\u00a0Over 500K people have signed the #BoycottTarget pledge. Good luck making the case they're just all bigot h8trs. Really. Best of luck there.\u2014 Jive Lurkey  (@MatlockFletcher) April 25, 2016Target, however, is not responding to customers\u2019 opposition. \u201cWe certainly respect that there are a wide variety of perspectives and opinions. As a company that firmly stands behind what it means to offer our team an inclusive place to work \u2014 and our guests an inclusive place to shop \u2014 we continue to believe that this is the right thing for Target, company\u00a0spokeswoman Molly Snyder said April 25.Amid the turmoil, the company\u2019s stock edged down from $83.98 per share on April 19 to roughly $81.33 in April 28.That\u2019s a loss of $2.65 per share, which chops the company\u2019s stock market value by $1.5 billion, down to $48.8 billion.The company\u2019s Twitter, however, has been very inactive. The most recent tweet was sent out April 19, even though the company has been sending out a tweet every two or three days in the first half of April.#Spring is in.
