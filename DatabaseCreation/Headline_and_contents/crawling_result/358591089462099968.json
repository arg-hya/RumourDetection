All right!\u201d said a visibly smiling Zimmerman, holding the winning lottery ticket he purchased on a whim hours after he was found not guilty for shooting and killing the unarmed 17-year-old. \u201cI just figured why not, you know? I think I\u2019ll probably use the money to buy a bigger house and a new car, and I\u2019ll invest the rest. This is just fantastic. Life is good.\u201d Zimmerman added that he\u2019ll never have to worry about money again."}
