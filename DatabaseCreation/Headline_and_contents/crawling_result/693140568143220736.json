In 1928, Hurt released several songs for the Okeh label before going silent for 35 years and working as a sharecropper, until his rediscovery during the early Sixties folk movement. He was tracked down at home in tiny Avalon, Mississippi, by young musicologist Dick Spottswood, who recounts telling Hurt: \u201cDon\u2019t you know how famous you are?\u201d Hurt didn\u2019t even have a guitar.Making the documentary \u201cwas like a journey of discovery to find out what was exactly the most important thing in recording music, and the things we most value,\u201d director Bernard MacMahon said of the project, which he co-created with producers Allison McGourty and Duke Erikson. (PBS will broadcast the series in the fall.) \u201cIts immediacy and energy and a moment, what they used to call \u2018lightning in a bottle.'\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve often remarked that music to the United States is as wine is to France. It\u2019s one of those never-ending stories.\u201d\u2014 T Bone BurnettAt the podium, Redford said the documentary shares a history of sound recordings that \u201callowed America to hear itself, telling stories about America itself. It started in small pockets in this country and then it spread.\u201dIn the late 1920s, Burnett said, \u201cthe record industry collapsed because radio had proliferated in the big cities and people could get music for free; [they] didn\u2019t want to pay for it anymore. So the record companies went down South and began recording the poorest people in the country, which led to this extraordinary explosion of blues, country music and rock & roll \u2026 everything we know today.\u201dThe screening included a look at how the mournful \u201cDark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\u201d by Blind Willie Johnson was chosen among other recordings by NASA to represent humanity and soar across the cosmos onboard the Voyager space probes launched in 1977. There was also a glimpse of the series\u2019 final chapter, where Burnett and White gather contemporary musicians from the Alabama Shakes to Elton John to record with the same ancient equipment, including the very first amplifier, first condenser microphone and acetate cutting machine.White and his band were shown gathered around a single microphone singing the obscure country-folk tune \u201cMatrimonial Intentions\u201d (\u201cIf you got no matrimonial intentions, keep your hands to yourself!\u201d), with fiddle, mandolin, upright bass and White\u2019s well-worn acoustic guitar. He\u2019s joined by Nas for \u201cOn the Road Again,\u201d which sounds like some tough contemporary hip-hop except that it\u2019s a faithful reading of the original 1928 lyrics by the Memphis Jug Band. It was cut straight to the mic and the lathe, no overdubs.\u00a0\u201cI love that kind of recording because you bring all of your focus and attention to bear on a moment,\u201d Burnett said before the screening. \u201cThat\u2019s the [point] when the sculptor hits the chisel. That\u2019s a beautiful thing. So many of the great records were made that way, including right now.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the documentary, White described the atmosphere: \u201cYou come prepared for this moment. It was like going to church.\u201d\u201cRadio was the new kid on the block, and they were saying, \u2018Nobody\u2019s going to buy records if they get it for free on the radio!\u2019 Hey, is there a familiar echo?\u201d\u2014 Taj MahalThe film excerpt was followed by a panel discussion with MacMahon, Burnett, White and bluesman Taj Mahal, who compared record industry woes past and present. \u201cRadio came along, and radio was the new kid on the block, and they were saying,\u201d Mahal said, adding in a whiny voice, \u201c\u2018Nobody\u2019s going to buy records if they get it for free on the radio!\u2019 Hey, is there a familiar echo? \u2018Who\u2019s going to buy a CD if they get it for free on the Internet?\u2019 How much money did they make in between then and now?\u201dBritish-born MacMahon relocated to Los Angeles to complete the three-year process of making the film, commissioned by public television station WNET in New York and the BBC. \u201cWhen you go into the most rural parts of America, you see old Celtic traditions that remind you of your great-grandparents,\u201d the onetime music video director said. \u201cI see reflections of a society that is almost gone in Britain, and that was really beautiful. There are parts of America that are largely unchanged, so this is a chance to tell some of their stories.\u201dBoth Mahal and the Avett Brothers, who also appear in the documentary, performed short sets after the screening. As he prepared to perform two folk-blues songs on a copper acoustic guitar, Mahal recalled meeting Hurt near the end of the elder bluesman\u2019s life, a moment included in the film. \u201cI went to see Mississippi John Hurt when I was 19. Now I\u2019m up there,\u201d the 73-year-old said with a laugh.The Avett Brothers performed three songs in stripped down mode, starting with \u201cJordan is a Hard Road to Travel,\u201d first recorded by Uncle Dave Macon in 1927, and performed by them in film. It was followed by the gospel hymn \u201cJust a Closer Walk With Thee,\u201d with three of them around the mic, singing to Seth Avett\u2019s acoustic guitar. (The Avetts \u00a0also performed with a full band at the screening\u2019s rousing afterparty-concert at Park City Live.)On their way into the screening, singer-banjo-player Scott Avett told Rolling Stone: \u201cWe heard about that machine and thought that sounded amazing. The whole group has an interest in old-time music. We perform it in our shows, we perform it on our bus and hotels. When we first heard a playback, our minds were just blown.\u201dSeth Avett added: \u201cI think there is something in people that connects with their soul when they hear acoustic instruments. It\u2019s not filtered.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tIn This Article:\n\t\t\t\tJack White,\t\t\t\tSundance,\t\t\t\tSundance Film Festival,\t\t\t\tT Bone Burnett,\t\t\t\tTaj Mahal,\t\t\t\tThe Avett Brothers \n\t\t\tWant more Rolling Stone?
