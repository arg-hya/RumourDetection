Rowling.VIDEO: Watch the entire NYC premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2The star had wonderful things to say about his role as Snape and few things sum it up as simply and perfectly as his goodbye letter to the Harry Potter franchise.Rickman's tribute to the series, for Empire Magazine in 2011, has been making the rounds again on Reddit today, and for good reason.In his letter, the late actor writes a simple and beautiful 'thank you' to Rowling and talks about how stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint grew up before our eyes in the films.\"A lifetime seems to have passed in minutes,\" wrote Rickman.\"It is an ancient need to be told stories,\" Rickman continued. \"But the story needs a great storyteller.\"Just as Rowling was able to breathe life into the characters she created in the Harry Potter series, the actors who embodied the roles on the big screen were storytellers, as well.Though we have lost ones of those actors, his presence and memory lives on in his performances and the memories his characters have given us.PHOTOS: The best Harry Potter movie momentsYour source for entertainment news, celebrities, celeb news, and \u200bcelebrity gossip.
