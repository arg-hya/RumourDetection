The only way to get justice is if there is a thorough investigation and that means getting access to the site as swiftly as possible ... it\u2019s imperative that the site is made available to investigators without molestation and hindrance as fast as possible.\u201dAbbott said the area is controlled by rebels and \u201cbodies remain strewn over the fields of Eastern Ukraine\u201d.He emphasised just how dangerous the situation is.\u201cOvernight, a monitoring mission from the organisation for the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe did gain temporary access but it was driven off by gunfire presumably from the Russian-backed rebels.\u201cThis does highlight though the difficulty and danger of this mission.\u201dAttempts to contact the Russian government have been unsuccessful so far.The Ukraine government had said it would give Australia all the support it needed to access the site to retrieve bodies and protect evidence.Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will be heading to the US to champion Australia\u2019s campaign at the UN Security Council for an independent comprehensive international investigation with access to the site, debris, black box and any possible witnesses.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have deployed six officers to Kiev and more are on their way, including a five-member emergency response team.

Suspicion has fallen on Russian-backed rebels, prompting calls for Moscow to be punished with trade sanctions.Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who met with his Russian counterpart Alexey Ulyukaev ahead of chairing the G20 meeting, didn\u2019t rule out the prospect of trade sanctions if Russia didn\u2019t play ball.\u201cThese are things we need to consider in the goodness of time,\u201d Mr Robb said.\u201cIt is a matter of how Russia responds, co-operates and is proactive in seeking answers.\u201dMalaysian prime minister\u2019s griefThe step-grandmother of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was on board MH17, the country\u2019s defence minister confirmed.Hishammuddin Hussein, a cousin of Najib\u2019s, said 83-year-old Siti Amirah was \u201con the flight\u201d.

Who had the equipment? It\u2019s obviously an anti-aircraft missile. Who could have had the expertise to do that? Because commercial airlines are big targets, but by the time they got over that part of Ukraine they should have been high, so it takes some planning [to target such a plane].\u201cAnd the Ukrainian government has been quick to blame it on terrorists, which is their name for the Russian insurgents.
