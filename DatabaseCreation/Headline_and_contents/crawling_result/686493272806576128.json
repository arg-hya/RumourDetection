And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way.\"His death was no different from his life - a work of Art.\"He made Blackstar for us, his parting gift.\"I knew for a year this was the way it would be. I wasn't, however, prepared for it.\"He was an extraordinary man, full of love and life. He will always be with us.\"For now, it is appropriate to cry.\"Visconti\u00a0has previously spoken of creating the album, which was recorded in just three sessions over the course of three months at the beginning of 2015.It now appears the singer and those closest to him arranged its release at the end of his life, after 18 months of living with cancer.Music videos for Blackstar and Lazarus both feature a skull motif, with lyrics that will now be read and re-read by fans.The title of Lazarus refers to the biblical character who was raised from the dead four days after he died by Jesus.The singer's 25th studio album, which features seven tracks, was the first that did not feature his photo on the cover but instead a black star.The Telegraph has already\u00a0given the album five stars, calling it \"extraordinary\".The tracks include:Something happened on the day he diedSpirit rose a metre and stepped asideSomebody else took his place, and bravely cried(I\u2019m a blackstar, I\u2019m a blackstar)\u200bLook up here, I'm in Heaven!I've got scars that can't be seenI've got drama, can't be stolen,Everybody knows me nowLook up here, man, I'm in danger!I've got nothing left to loseI'm so high, it makes my brain whirlDropped my cellphone down belowAin't that just like me?!By the time I got to New YorkI was living like a kingThen I used up all my moneyI was looking for your assThis way or no wayYou know I'll be freeJust like that bluebirdNow, ain't that just like me?Oh, I'll be freeJust like that bluebirdOh, I'll be freeAin't that just like me?\u00a0\u00a0SueThe clinic calledThe x-ray's fineI brought you homeI just said homeSue, you said you want it writtenSue, the virgin on your stoneFor your graveWhy too dark to speak the words?For, I know that you have a sonOh, folly, Sue\u00a0I know something is very wrongThe pulse returns the prodigal sonsThe blackout hearts, the flowered newsWith skull designs upon my shoes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
