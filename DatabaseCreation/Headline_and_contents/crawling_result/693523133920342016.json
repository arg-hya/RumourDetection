Nicole Lurie, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the United States Public Health Service, said 26 water samples, out of nearly 4,000 collected, contained lead at levels higher than 150 parts per billion. The Environmental Protection Agency recommends that lead in drinking water should be below 15 parts per billion.Flint residents received filters designed to remove lead up to 150 parts per billion, Ms. Lurie said, adding that they could still be effective above that level. \u201cThis does not mean that we think there\u2019s a problem with the filters,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, everything we know tells us that they are performing well.\u201dStill, she said, all residents should have their water tested as soon as possible. Officials also cautioned that children under 6 and pregnant women should use bottled water for drinking and preparing food. Residents and advocates have expressed outrage over the government\u2019s failure to protect Flint\u2019s children, something many of them say would not have happened if the city were largely white. Adding to their injury, they say, are the harsh conditions of poverty that have already placed obstacles in their young lives.At the same time, many are turning their attention to the future, when the effects of consuming lead-laced water for months may be all too evident.At the center of those efforts is Dr. Hanna-Attisha, whose research documenting a spike in children\u2019s blood lead levels forced dismissive government officials to acknowledge the water crisis last fall. With her colleagues at Hurley Children\u2019s Hospital, where she directs the pediatric residency program, she is at the forefront of the scramble to put in place the resources so that every child who needs extra help learning or overcoming medical problems will have support for years to come.Decades of research have found that exposure to even low levels of lead can profoundly affect children\u2019s growth, behavior and intelligence over time. Studies have linked elevated lead levels in blood to learning disabilities, problems with attention and fine motor coordination, and even violent behavior.Younger children and fetuses are especially vulnerable because of their developing brains and nervous systems, which is why the efforts here will focus on children 5 and younger.Emails released by the office of Gov. Rick Snyder last week referred to a resident who said she was told by a state nurse in January 2015, regarding her son\u2019s elevated blood lead level, \u201cIt is just a few IQ points. ... It is not the end of the world.\u201d Dr. Hanna-Attisha and others who have studied lead poisoning have a sharply different view of lead exposure, for which there is no cure. \u201cIf you were going to put something in a population to keep them down for generations to come, it would be lead,\u201d Dr. Hanna-Attisha said.Underlying the problem are the troubling conditions prevalent among low-income children and their families in cities like Flint: spotty access to doctors and health care services; a dearth of healthy foods; living conditions so poor that many of the children may have already been exposed to lead poisoning from the paint in their homes; parents with limited time and financial resources.The doctors here said they would focus on improving the diets of affected children and expanding education programs like Head Start, the federally funded preschool program for low-income children, which has a waiting list in Flint. Dr. Hanna-Attisha has submitted dozens of recommendations to the governor, state legislators and federal officials.Timeline of the critical moments leading to the public health emergency.It remains a wish list at this point, but she and others believe that with Flint\u2019s public health crisis in the national spotlight, the city\u2019s chances of getting help are better than ever before.Mr. Snyder and the State Legislature have so far allocated $28 million in emergency state spending for Flint. Some of the money will provide initial services, like health assessments and home visits from nurses, to lead-exposed children. Mr. Snyder has also asked the federal government to expand Medicaid to cover every Flint resident younger than 21, regardless of income level. And Democrats in Congress said on Thursday that they would seek $600 million in federal aid for Michigan to help Flint.Local philanthropic groups have set up a charitable fund with the goal of improving health outcomes for children exposed to lead, including through Dr. Hanna-Attisha\u2019s project, the Pediatric Public Health Initiative. Psychologists, nutritionists and child development experts are among the participants in the project, which Hurley is overseeing with Michigan State University\u2019s College of Human Medicine, where Dr. Hanna-Attisha is an assistant professor of pediatrics.\u201cWe have a unique opportunity to build a model public health program here,\u201d Dr. Hanna-Attisha said. \u201cWe have to throw every single evidence-based resource at these kids, starting now.\u201dIt is impossible to gauge how each child will be affected, partly because the developmental effects of lead poisoning may take years to emerge. A flurry of lead testing has taken place since October, when the Genessee County Health Department finally declared a public health emergency. The agency told residents to stop drinking the water, which was coming from the Flint River, rather than Lake Huron, in an attempt to save money.Experts say the testing may provide false reassurance. Most residents have probably switched to drinking bottled water, and since lead can be detected in the blood for only about a month, test results may not reflect the extent of their exposure.\u201cOur kids are already rattled by every kind of toxic stress you can think of,\u201d Dr. Hanna-Attisha said. \u201cEvery single day in our clinic we have a 40 percent no-show rate, and it\u2019s not because parents don\u2019t love their children.\u201dShe emphasized, however, that not every child exposed to lead would suffer ill effects. Kim Dietrich, a professor of environmental health at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, said that based partly on the blood lead levels of children in Dr. Hanna-Attisha\u2019s study, he did not think serious long-term health problems would be widespread.About 57 percent of Flint\u2019s 99,000 residents are black, and 40 percent live in poverty, one of the highest rates in the nation for a city its size. Bilal Tawwab, the superintendent of the city school system, said that one school nurse serves the 5,400 students in the district, but that he hoped some of the money flowing into Flint might help open health centers in every school.He also hoped to make prekindergarten available to every 4-year-old \u2014 spaces are limited \u2014 and to hire more experienced teachers for special education.transcriptSOUNDBITE 2 - Rick Snyder, Governor of Michigan (man, English, 13 sec):\n\u201cTo you the people of Flint, I say tonight as I have before, I\u2019m sorry and I will fix it. No citizen of this great state should endure this catastrophe.\u201d\n//\nTEXT CARD: In November 2015, almost two months before the Governor apologized, residents filed a lawsuit against city and state officials.\n//\n1.

SOUNDBITE (English): Melissa Mays, Flint Resident: \n\u201cWe\u2019re (Flint is) 41 percent under the poverty line.

SOUNDBITE (English): Melissa Mays, Flint Resident: \n\u201cWhat price do you put on your children\u2019s brains? Their bones? Their organs that are permanently damaged? How do you figure out how much that\u2019s worth? \n//\nSOUNDBITE 3 - Rick Snyder, Governor of Michigan (man, English, 08 sec):\n\u201cGovernment failed you, federal state and local leaders by breaking the trust you placed in us.\u201d\n//\nSOUNDBITE (English) Jimmy Taylor, Flint Resident:\n\u201cIt should have never got to this point, We\u2019re surrounded by the Great Lakes, the world\u2019s greatest fresh water supply. We shouldn\u2019t be going through this here in Flint, Mich.\u201d\n//\nSOUNDBITE 1 - Jesse Fulkerson, protester (man, English, 11 sec):\n\u201cHe\u2019s already apologized, but that doesn\u2019t mean much when people are poisoned so I think he should resign. I don\u2019t think he should be our governor anymore, if not he should be impeached by rest of the congress.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the piece that keeps me up at night,\u201d he said. \u201cIt costs almost double to educate a student with special needs. And our wages, our salaries, are so low.\u201dRuth Ann Norton, executive director of the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, based in Baltimore, said that even children who got intensive educational help after lead exposure might face lifelong obstacles.\u201cEven kids who are able to get through school, and even to get to college, they struggle,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I will tell you that they are exhausted.\u201dDr. Hanna-Attisha and others are urging families to feed their children foods rich in calcium, iron and vitamin C, which can help minimize the amount of lead their bodies absorb. Yet that raises another problem: Flint is a food desert, with no large grocery stores within the city limits.Dr. Hanna-Attisha said that while lead was the primary concern, the researchers also worried about the effect of total trihalomethanes, or TTHMs, chemical compounds found in Flint\u2019s water after the city pumped extra chlorine into the system to address bacteria problems after switching to river water. Some studies have linked TTHMs in water to higher miscarriage rates.Many in Flint have had skin irritation and rashes in the past 18 months, which Dr. Hanna-Attisha attributes to the extra chlorine and TTHMs in the water. Because they were slow to make the connection, she and other doctors are trying to make up for it, with checkups for young children presenting a prime opportunity.At Taeyana\u2019s appointment, Dr. Hanna-Attisha held the baby\u2019s face close to hers as she rattled off instructions that were the same as she had been giving for years, but were more urgent now.\u201cHer brain is growing so much from now until she\u2019s 2,\u201d she told Ms. Towns, \u201cso this is when you want to read to her and sing to her and smile at her and tell her what you\u2019re doing every minute.\u201dThe family would return next week for King\u2019s checkup, and his first lead test. For now, Ms. Towns is focused on getting through each day, making sure she has enough bottled water to prepare formula for Taeyana every two hours.\u201cInstead of them donating all this water, what can they do about the pipes?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat can they do?\u201dAdvertisement"}
