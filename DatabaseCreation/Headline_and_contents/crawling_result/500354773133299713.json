A Ferguson police officer who had pulled up behind Davis reportedly mistook him to be another Henry Davis (with a different middle name and Social Security number), who had an outstanding warrant. The arresting police officer allegedly took Davis' cell phone out of his hand, cuffed him, and placed him in the back of a patrol car without explanation.Once Davis was at the Ferguson jail, he was allegedly assaulted by four officers, who slammed him against a wall, hit him, and kicked him. Davis was taken to a nearby hospital, where he refused treatment. He spent several days in jail before posting a $1,500 bond on four counts of \"property damage.\"In a subsequent civil trial brought by Davis, the Ferguson police officers' complaints that Davis had transferred blood to their uniforms were revealed to not just be bizarre, but trumped up (and remember, the whole incident happened because Davis was wrongfully arrested in the first place). However, a federal magistrate ruled that the apparent perjury was too minor to constitute a violation of due process, and Davis' injuries were too minor to constitute excessive force.Related StoriesSTORY CONTINUES BELOWThe trial is currently in appeals, and Davis' lawyer\u00a0James Schottel\u00a0now believes that the previous minimal ruling might be seen differently in the context of Michael Brown's death.\u00a0Read Davis' stunning full account here, and go here to see everything we know about the Michael Brown case so far.[via Daily Beast]\u00a0Join the conversation on Complex today!Share This Story"}
