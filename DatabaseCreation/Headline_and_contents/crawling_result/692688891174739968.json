The report measures how Americans feel about their physical health, social connections, finances, community and sense of purpose.The islands took the top spot for the fifth time since the annual state rankings began eight years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s not ever a shock to see Hawaii high (on the list),\u201d Dan Witters, principal research director of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, told TODAY.\u201cHawaiians rate their lives pretty high\u2026 things like enjoyment, smiling and laughter and happiness are all very high in Hawaii. And stress is very low.\u201dHawaii has the lowest depression rate and the best exercise rate in the nation, Witters said. Very few people who live there are obese or smoke \u2014 a good formula for good health.Alaska, last year\u2019s overall well-being champ, fell to second place.The top five states for overall well-being are: 1. Hawaii2. Alaska3. Montana4. Colorado5. WyomingRelated: Adult happiness declines, while teen contentment growsOn the opposite side of the spectrum, West Virginia was at the bottom of the list, coming in 50th for the seventh year in a row, Witters said.\u201cWest Virginia is a low well-being place,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey experience a lot of sadness, a lot of worry, a lot of stress on any given day.\u201dResidents there reported some of the worst rates in the nation for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, depression, physical pain and heart attacks. The state\u2019s obesity rate was the highest in the U.S., at 37 percent, while its exercise rate was the lowest.The five states at the bottom of the list are:50. West Virginia49. Kentucky48. Oklahoma47. Ohio46. IndianaThe index is based on interviews with more than 177,000 Americans over the past year. Here are some of the report\u2019s other key findings:The researchers asked people to imagine a ladder with 10 rungs, where the top rung is best possible life, and bottom is the worst possible life. Where are you on that ladder?The results were the highest since the index began. The number of people considered to be \u201cthriving\u201d is now at 55 percent, compared to barely over 40 percent during the Great Recession.South Dakota.\u201cOne of the things we find fairly consistently in the Northern Plains and Mountain West is stress levels are lower. Daily sadness and worry tends to be lower. People don\u2019t carry around a lot of emotional baggage on a day to day basis,\u201d Witters said.Besides Hawaii, Colorado is the only other state to finish in the top 10 in all eight years of the index\u2019s rankings.Residents there take good care of themselves and exercise a lot, Witters noted. Coloradans also report good community well-being, so they feel good about where they live, he added.Related: Retirement boosts happiness, improves health, study findsMany states that historically rank high on the list don\u2019t necessarily have gorgeous scenery or year-round warm weather, like Hawaii.The local culture and how people feel about their communities play bigger roles in well-being than the physical beauty of a state, Witters said.Arizona broke into top 10 for the first time.Florida was at No. 12, its best finish so far.Alabama, which has historically placed at the bottom of the list, improved to the middle of the pack.Vermont had the biggest drop year-over year, tumbling from No. 13 to No. 29, its worst showing so far.The rate of smoking among U.S. adults dropped to 18.5 percent in 2015, the lowest since Gallup started tracking this metric in the 1950s. Utah has lowest smoking rate at 9 percent.The obesity rate, which came in at 28 percent, \u201chas been going up relentlessly\u201d since the index started, Witters said.\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem and it\u2019s not a problem that\u2019s going away or getting better,\u201d he noted.Hawaii and Colorado have the lowest obesity rates \u2014 under 20 percent in each state.Follow A.
