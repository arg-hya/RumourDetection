Damage to life and property this time has been much less, partly due to swift action by the local police but also because the university had its own team of more than 50 trained security guards.A dense fog that reduced visibility to less than 10 metres may also have been a factor.Imran Khan, head of the opposition\u00a0PTI which governs Khyber\u00a0Pakhtunkhwa province, has described the attack as \"cowardly\".The cricketer-turned-politician is travelling\u00a0to the scene.A witness told local TV how a friend leapt from a high window to escape the\u00a0militants, who were chanting \"Allah is the greatest\".The main spokesman for the Pakistan Taliban - the TTP - has\u00a0denied that the group\u00a0carried out the attack.In\u00a0a statement,\u00a0Mohammad Khurasani described the attack as\u00a0\"un-Islamic\" and said the group\u00a0would hold people accountable for using\u00a0its name.His statement contradicts\u00a0a\u00a0senior Pakistan Taliban commander, who earlier\u00a0claimed that the group was\u00a0responsible\u00a0for the attack.Twitter users in\u00a0Pakistan and beyond have been paying tribute to Syed Hamid Hussain, a Chemistry professor at the university who reportedly fired back at the militants before he was shot dead.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has condemned the attack and sent his condolences to the families of the victims.ARY News' online editor Omar Qurashi has told the BBC that the university appears to have been chosen because it was an easy target:It's a soft target, it's a private university in a town that's not in one of the major cities in the country where security measures have gone up.... So I think it's been chosen for that reason and to send a message again.Because of the military's on-going operation against the Taliban in the tribal areas. They're trying to send a message to them that 'You're still vulnerable'.Imran Khan, the leader of the PTI party which rules the area where the university is located, has condemned the attack, Geo TV reports.\"I am going to Charsadda myself, and will review the situation myself. We are united against terrorism and all of Pakistan is on [the same] page,\" he told reporters.The hashtags #Charsadda and #BachaKhanUniversity have been trending among Pakistani Twitter users as the country reacts: AFP have quoted a student who was speaking to Pakistani TV:We saw three terrorists shouting, 'Allah is great!' and rushing towards the stairs of our department...One student jumped out of the classroom through the window. We never saw him get upThe student also described seeing a chemistry professor holding a pistol and firing at the attackers. \u00a0Then we saw him fall down and as the terrorists entered the office we ran awayAFP say they have spoken to a\u00a0Pakistani Taliban commander, who says his group was behind\u00a0the attack.\u00a0Speaking by telephone from an undisclosed location, Umar\u00a0Mansoor said it was in response to a military offensive against extremists in the tribal areas. \u00a0Our four suicide attackers carried out the attack on Bacha Khan University todayPakistan's media regulator Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) has asked the media not to reveal the movements of security personnel or students, Radio Pakistan reports.Parents are\u00a0saying that\u00a0security arrangements\u00a0at Bacha Khan University were not good enough, according to\u00a0Reuters Pakistan correspondent\u00a0Mehreen Zahra-Malik.The\u00a0Taliban have\u00a0claimed responsibility for the\u00a0attack, AFP reports.Local Pakistani media have also reported the Taliban claim.People react following the attack.The BBC's Shahzeb Jillani has more details on the attack:The gunmen entered the university by climbing over the back wall. Intense gunfire and explosions were heard as security guards fought the attackers. Students and staff ran to find cover in bathrooms and examination halls.By the time police and Pakistani army commandos arrived, several students and staff members were dead and dozens of others wounded. Most people have now been evacuated. The army says it is conducting a search operation to clear the area.At least four\u00a0seriously injured people have been rushed to Peshawar's Lady Reading hospital, the BBC's Ilyas Khan reports."}
