He is rarely pressed by voters on what will replace it. But at a middle school cafeteria here, a man, Mike Valde, presented him with a tragic tale. His brother-in-law Mark                                                was a barber \u2014 \u201ca small-business man,\u201d he said. He had never had a paid vacation day. He received health insurance at last because of the Affordable Care Act. He began to feel sick and\n                                                went to a doctor.\u201cHe had never been to a doctor for years,\u201d Mr. Valde, 63, of Coralville, Iowa, said. \u201cMultiple tumors behind his heart, his liver, his pancreas. And they said, \u2018We\u2019re sorry,\n                                                sir, there\u2019s nothing we can do for you.\u2019 \u201dThe room was silent.\u201cMark never had health care until Obama care,\u201d Mr. Valde continued. \u201cWhat are you going to replace it with?\u201dMr. Cruz expressed condolences and pivoted quickly to a well-worn answer assailing the health care law.Mr. Cruz said \u201cmillions of Americans\u201d had lost their jobs and their doctors as a result of the law, and that many had \u201cseen their premiums skyrocket.\u201dHe said he had often joked about a pledge by Mr. Obama that premiums would drop: \u201cAnyone whose premiums have dropped $2,500, as President Obama promised, should vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Cruz\n                                                said. \u201cI\u2019ll take everybody else.\u201dMany in the room laughed. Mr. Valde \u2014 who said in an interview later that he did in fact intend to caucus for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 pressed on.\u201cMy question is, what are you going to replace it with?\u201d he said.Mr. Cruz said he was getting there, but had to lay out the problems with the law first. \u201cThere are millions of stories on the other side,\u201d he said, describing voters who had liked their insurance\n                                                plans and lost them because the plans did not provide the level of coverage the new law required.He went on to describe elements of his plan, which includes an effort to allow people to purchase insurance across state lines.Mr. Cruz turned back to Mr. Valde. \u201cYour father-in-law, he couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d he said.\u201cBrother-in-law,\u201d Mr. Valde said.\u201cYour brother-in-law couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.\u201cRight,\u201d Mr. Valde said. \u201cBut he could afford it \u2014 he finally got it under Obama.\u201d\u201cHe would have gotten it earlier, if he could have afforded it earlier,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cBut because of government regulations he couldn\u2019t.\u201dMoments later, Mr. Cruz wrapped up and Mr. Valde sat down.
