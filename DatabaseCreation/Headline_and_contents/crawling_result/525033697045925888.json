Nathan Cirillo dreamed of becoming full-time soldier", "content": "The opening shots that began a devastating day on Parliament Hill\u00a0killed a Hamilton reservist who dreamed of being a full-time soldier\u00a0and deprived\u00a0his kindergarten-aged son of his father.\u00a0Cpl. Nathan\u00a0Cirillo, 24, was shot while on\u00a0honorary\u00a0guard at the National War Memorial.\u00a0Ottawa Police announced hours\u00a0after the shooting that the soldier shot at the memorial had died.He would later be identified as\u00a0Cirillo, a reservist from Hamilton serving with the\u00a0Argyll\u00a0and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada regiment.\u00a0Cirillo\u00a0died a short time after the attack\u00a0despite frantic efforts to revive him at the base of the Tomb\u00a0of the Unknown Soldier.Lt.-Col. Lawrence Hatfield of the Argylls made a brief statement on Wednesday night to reporters and members of the public who gathered outside the James Street armoury.\"The regiment wishes to express its sincere condolences to the family of Cpl. Cirillo as well as to express our thanks that's been demonstrated by the support of Canadians across this country,\" he said. \"Cpl. Cirillo was a very proud member of the Argylls and the Highlanders of Canada. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, and we hope that Canadians share that with us.\"Back in East Hamilton, the news spread through his extended the family. A distraught uncle, Jim Cirillo, answered the door to his Barton Street East home with swollen eyes, a TV\u00a0locked on the 24-hour news cycle of the unfolding events, and a computer opened to a picture of his nephew, Nathan. Between tears, he pointed at the picture on the screen. He said his sister-in-law and mother to Nathan, Kathy, couldn\u2019t believe the news.\u201cShe's saying she doesn't believe it\u00a0\u2026 She went on the internet and she saw it and she \u2026 I don't know how she didn't pass out.\u201cShe's just completely broken, broken right now.\"Jim Cirillo said Nathan and his two sisters weren't \"dealt a good hand,\" with a difficult divorce splitting up their parents.\"And now for him to get shot and pass away, I don't know if life is fair \u2026 he didn't deserve that,\" he said. \"I don't know how someone could have picked him out and do that.\"Along with\u00a0Hamilton Police Chief Glenn De Caire, Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina\u00a0visited the family and told reporters outside\u00a0the armoury\u00a0where Cirillo joined as a cadet when he was\u00a013\u00a0years old\u00a0that he expects the fallen soldier to have a funeral with \u201cfull service honours.\u201d\"It was very sad but there was some comfort in being with Chief De Caire, who has experience with dealing with sudden loss of life,\"\u00a0Bratina said. \"We had some hugs and tears. One young boy walked in and said to his aunt, I believe it was, 'I saw you crying.'\"Bratina said Cirillo had two sisters, and was part of \"a typical Hamilton family. Beautiful home. Clean as a whip. Pictures of Nathan and his two sisters on the wall. It was the kind of place that any of us would feel right at home going into.\"Jim Cirillo confirmed that Nathan's father has been in Costa Rica for several years. Nathan\u00a0had tried to reconnect with his father\u00a0a few years ago, and had recently reconnected with his mother. She\u00a0will be taking care of his son, Marcus, who just entered kindergarten, and his two dogs. The child's\u00a0mother, who had the baby while Cirillo was still a teenager, is no longer in the picture.Cirillo was a personal trainer, former Good Life fitness employee and bouncer at a downtown Hamilton bar, Club Absinthe.Manager Billy Pozeg said he would often come straight from the armoury in his fatigues, and change at the club before his shifts, joking he would go from one service job to another. He added Cirillo would bring up the mood in a room with a smile as wide as his shoulders, adding his dream was to be a full-time member of the military.His pictures posted on Facebook and Instagram show\u00a0a man always smiling, who played guitar and loved his two large dogs. He posed for tourists shortly before he was attacked.\u00a0A source who asked not to be identified told CBC News in Hamilton that members from the unit have all been ordered not to speak about the incident.\"They are now all on communication lockdown,\"\u00a0the source said. \"They\u2019ve been told to put their phones away and all bases are all locked down.\"Cirillo's friend, Marie Michele, has been trying to make sense of the news all day. She first realized\u00a0Cirillo had been shot when pictures\u00a0of paramedics trying to save his life was shown on television Wednesday morning.\"I saw his face and it was him,\" Michele said. \"That's how I found out it was Nathan.\u00a0\"Nathan was a good man. He would give anything to anyone,\" she said. \"He was there for everyone.\"Police have set up a roadblock\u00a0around the Cirillo family's home in east Hamilton\u00a0while they decide who will be their spokesperson.Members of Canada\u2019s Muslim community offered condolences to the family, condemning the attack.\u201cThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama\u2019at Canada categorically and unequivocally condemns this morning\u2019s terror attacks on the Canadian Parliament and the National War Memorial as well as on the Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec,\u201d the organization said in a statement released Wednesday. \u201cThese acts of terror have no basis in any religion.\u201dThe Argylls are an infantry unit of the Canadian Forces primary reserves within 31 Canadian Brigade Group. It is one of the largest army reserve units in the country with over 250 soldiers.Retired Col. Geordie Elms said Hamilton\u2019s Highland regiment served in the first two World Wars, as well as Afghanistan, contributing more manpower than any other militia in Ontario. He knew it was an Argyll when he saw the uniform.\u201cIt was terrible anyway. Then it became clear where this had taken place. That\u2019s a ceremonial duty that goes to commemorating our history,\u201d Elms said. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic that it\u2019s one of our Argylls.\u201dOn average, Elms said a reservist dedicates one night a week and one weekend a month to it. Every year, there\u2019ll be a concentrated exercise where it might be a week or 10 days.Elms said the greatest single force of reservist recruits is still students, because of the nature of the work and the potential to do training during the summer period.\u00a0\u201cFor this particular task to guard the War Memorial and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, they would have put out a notice and he would have answered it,\u201d Elms said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour and a privilege to do that duty, just as it would be if you were to be part of the ceremonial guard on Parliament Hill in the summertime. It\u2019s a sought-after task. It\u2019s not a task they have any trouble filling.\u201dThe soldiers who were guarding the National War Memorial are part of a ceremonial guard, and full-time and part-time soldiers are rotated through duty on an hourly or bi-hourly basis. They carry rifles that aren't loaded.CBC News has obtained a copy of an\u00a0email directed to student soldiers with the\u00a0Armed Forces telling them not to wear their uniforms, even on base.Another email sent to military personnel authorized the wearing of uniforms on base, as well as inside their cars while travelling between the base and their homes, but that they should avoid wearing their uniforms in all other cases. The\u00a0email also instructed military personnel in uniform not to make any stops\u00a0\u2014 not even at gas stations,\u00a0daycares, schools and elsewhere\u00a0\u2014 while travelling between their base and home.At the armoury in Hamilton, non-uniformed people were passing in and out of the gates, with uniformed guards standing watch at each side. People have been bringing flowers and notices of condolences to the building.Veteran Ed Hughes dropped off a cross to the armoury Wednesday. \"I was injured in service,\" he said. \"It broke my heart when I found out he was from Hamilton. It broke my heart he was a Sutherland.\"With files from Stephanie MatteisTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).
