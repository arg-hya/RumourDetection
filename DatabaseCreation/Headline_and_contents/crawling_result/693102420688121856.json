What does that mean\u00a0exactly?\u00a0\n\tIn the U.S., the typical woman who is working full-time still earns just $0.79 for every 41 a man earns. That gender pay gap is even larger for women of color, and can result in the loss of hundred of thousands of dollars over a woman's lifetime.\u00a0\n\n\tIn short, this is less a day to celebrate and more a day to recognize that work remains to make equality a reality for millions of women across the country.\n\tSince taking office, President Obama has made equal pay a top priority. Here's a few of the steps he's taken to make progress on that goal:\n\tThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed on January 29, 2009,\u00a0is the very first piece of legislation that President Obama signed into law. The law, named after a woman who discovered her employer was paying less than men doing the same job, makes it easier for women\u00a0to effectively challenge unequal pay. The law\u00a0amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so that unfair pay complaints can be filed within 180 days of a discriminatory paycheck -- and that 180 days resets after each paycheck.\n\n\tIn his first official State of the Union Address, President Obama pledged to crack down on violations of equal pay laws. So he created the National Equal Pay Task Force that year to bring together the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Office of Personnel Management\u00a0to help understand the full scope of the wage gap, to enforce laws already prohibiting pay discrimination, and ensure the employees and employers are educated on their rights and obligations with respect to wage discrimination.\u00a0\n\n\tYou can read the Task Force's full report here.\u00a0\n\tIn 2014, President Obama used his own executive authority to prohibit federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss or inquire about their compensation. It provides a critical tool encourage pay transparency, so workers have a potential way of discovering violations of equal pay laws and are able to seek the appropriate remedies.\u00a0\n\n\tThe Obama administration is working to annually collect summary pay data by gender, race, and ethnicity from businesses with 100 or more employees. This step will cover 63 million employees and\u00a0help focus public enforcement of our equal pay laws and provide better insight into discriminatory pay practices across industries and professions.\u00a0\n\n\tThe President has taken a number of steps within his power to help narrow the wage gap between men and women in this country -- but he cannot accomplish this alone. That's why he's calling on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act -- commonsense legislation that updates the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to give\u00a0women additional tools to fight pay discrimination.\u00a0\n\tWhen President John F. Kennedy signed the original Equal Pay Act into law, women were paid 59 cents for every dollar paid to men. After more than 50 years, that gap has narrowed to 79 cents. We need to close this gap for good.
