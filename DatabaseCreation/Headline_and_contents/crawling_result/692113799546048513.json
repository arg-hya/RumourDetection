Within mere hours of their debut, he was sure to clarify that they weren't necessary for, y'know, seeing purposes, but rather, looking good. Fashion, baby. The glasses made their debut on \"Good Morning America,\" but they've popped up a number of times since, with good reason\u2014they look a-m-a-z-i-n-g. On the red carpet, they add a dash of sophistication to Niall's uncharacteristically formal outfit. Doesn't this look like someone who would read Ulysses while sitting by a fire? Yes. Yes, it does.  On stage, combined with his patterned shirt, they transform him into a someone you'd expect to see at a Black Keys concert. So, yes, they definitely add a new, mature element to his look. While we've seen faux glasses come and go many times over, and as much as I love the pair Niall's been wearing, I was curious to find out why now, in the year 2015, he decided to start wearing 'em.  It seems as though the answer is twofold\u2014the fashion industry has begun featuring glasses more prominently and\u2014?\u2014they're cheaper than ever. At Fall 2015 shows, brands like Burberry and Gucci (above) sent models down the runway wearing glasses, an accessory that is typically\u2014and deliberately\u2014left off of runways. Their growing popularity is also great news for people who actually need glasses to see and can't deal with contacts\u2014fans of Kylie Jenner-esque nails, rejoice. While designer frames may cost upwards of $200, brands like Topshop, as The Telegraph reports, are selling pairs for $30. IDK about you, but it's not often that I come across a $30 necklace that also makes me look like an intellectual\u2014I totally get what Niall found appealing. Plus, LBR, if Harry compliments your glasses, the desire to keep wearing them only grows, I imagine. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some shopping to do.  "}
