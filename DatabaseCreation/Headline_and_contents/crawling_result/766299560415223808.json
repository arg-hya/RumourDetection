The fourth, Ryan Lochte, returned to the US on Monday.Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger were prevented from leaving Brazil at Rio de Janeiro airport on Wednesday night and have since been questioned by police. Team-mate James Feigen has also remained in Brazil and says he is co-operating with the authorities.Five times Lochte made a splashThe swimmers, who have repeatedly changed their accounts of what happened, could \"in theory\" face charges of giving false testimony and vandalism, Mr Veloso told reporters during a news conference at Rio police headquarters.Mr Lochte was \"very angry because he was intoxicated\" during the incident, he said.The people of Rio were unhappy to see the reputation of their city damaged, Mr Veloso said, adding: \"We are dealing with important public figures who influence others and should know how to comport themselves... An apology would be welcomed.\"Earlier, a Rio 2016 spokesman had tried to make light of the case.\"These kids tried to have fun, they tried to represent their country to the best of their abilities,\" Mario Andrada told reporters.\"They competed under gigantic pressure. Let's give these kids a break. Sometime you take actions that you later regret.\"They had fun, they made a mistake, life goes on.\"Sunday 14 AugustMonday 15 AugustTuesday 16 AugustWednesday 17 AugustThursday 18 AugustLochte is one of the most successful swimmers in history, with 12 Olympic medals, and he once had his own reality television show in the US.
