Rory and Lorelai are coming back, too, as Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel will be returning in original roles of mother and daughter Gilmore.  Graham tweeted the news Friday evening with a photo of her smiling while holding a jacket that Graham \"stole\" from the show's costume department.  \"It's time for me, and this jacket I stole in 2007, to return to work,\" Graham tweeted. I CAN NOW CONFIRM: it's time for me, and this jacket I stole in 2007, to return to work.@netflix #GilmoreGirls pic.twitter.com/tBb07J9oO1  Netflix also confirmed that other cast members Scott Patterson, Sean Gunn, Kelly Bishop, and Keiko Agena will all be returning. However, the streaming company did not say when the show would be premiering or what its title would be.  The series will be produced in association with Warner Bros. Television, which is owned by CNN's parent company Time Warner (TWX).  This is not the first time Netflix has revived a popular television series for a nostalgic fanbase.  Netflix ordered a continuation of the 1990s ABC series \"Full House\" with a new title, \"Fuller House\" in April.  Remakes and reboots have been hot commodities with TV networks as of late with \"The Muppets\" and \"The X-Files\" all returning to the airwaves.  Related: Remake fever! 'Full House' the latest to get a second life  The return of fan favorites has at times been rewarded with big viewerships.  For example, Fox's \"X-Files\" nabbed 16.2 million viewers for its return on Sunday, a figure that grew to over 20 million when accounting for delayed viewing, according to the network. \n        Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
