Any pure breeds left? #CNNDebate\u2014 Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) January 20, 2012\nPerfect Obama's dad born in Africa, Mitt Romney's dad born in Mexico. Any pure breeds left? #CNNDebateOstensibly, Pierson is somehow trying to imply that having a parent born overseas makes someone less American, or to put it in more menacing, eugenical terms, \u00e2\u0080\u009cless pure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also worth noting that Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother was actually born in Scotland\u00e2\u0080\u0094though I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the life of me figure out why she might have let that one slide (I can). Pierson\u00e2\u0080\u0094who, like her boss, wants to ban all Muslims from being able to enter the U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0094is also a big proponent of Donald Trump using America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arsenal in some capacity (any capacity!), saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat good does it do to have a good nuclear triad if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re afraid to use it?\u00e2\u0080\u009dFour years before Pierson tweeted about the lack of pure breeds in American politics, she sued her employer for racial discrimination. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached out to Pierson for comment on the tweet (which, at the time of publication, has yet to be deleted) and will update if and when we hear back.[h/t @wupton]Contact the author at ashley@gawker.com."}
