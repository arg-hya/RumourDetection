Daniel Radcliffe AKA Harry Potter himself, wrote an emotional post on his Google Plus page that highlighted how wonderful the British actor was despite what people might have assumed given his character's intimidating persona.\"Alan Rickman is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with. He is also, one of the loyalest and most supportive people I've ever met in the film industry. He was so encouraging of me both on set and in the years post-Potter,\" he wrote. \"I'm pretty sure he came and saw everything I ever did on stage both in London and New York. He didn't have to do that. I know other people who've been friends with him for much much longer than I have and they all say 'if you call Alan, it doesn't matter where in the world he is or how busy he is with what he's doing, he'll get back to you within a day.'\"WATCH: Is Daniel Radcliffe going to appear in the Harry Potter prequel?Even though Snape turned out to be a kindhearted professor\u2014Harry even honored his life by naming his child after him\u2014Radcliffe understood that viewers might confuse onscreen characters with real life personalities. His statement put to rest any scary thoughts you might have had about the star.\"People create perceptions of actors based on the parts they played so it might surprise some people to learn that contrary to some of the sterner (or downright scary) characters he played, Alan was extremely kind, generous, self-deprecating and funny,\" the statement continued. \"And certain things obviously became even funnier when delivered in his unmistakable double-bass.\"As an actor he was one of the first of the adults on Potter to treat me like a peer rather than a child,\" he continued. \"Working with him at such a formative age was incredibly important and I will carry the lessons he taught me for the rest of my life and career. Film sets and theatre stages are all far poorer for the loss of this great actor and man.\"Author J.K. Rowling also paid tribute to the Die Hard star by tweeting, \"There are no words to express how shocked and devastated I am to hear of Alan Rickman's death. He was a magnificent actor & a wonderful man. My thoughts are with Rima and the rest of Alan's family. We have all lost a great talent. They have lost part of their hearts.Emma Watson AKA Hermione Granger also shared kind words on her Facebook page. \"I'm very sad to hear about Alan today. I feel so lucky to have worked and spent time with such a special man and actor,\" she wrote. \"I'll really miss our conversations. RIP Alan. We love you.\"She also posted some of his best quotes on her Twitter page, which can be seen here.READ: Surprise!

She also co-starred with him in Love Actually. \"What I remember most in this painful leave-taking is his humour, intelligence, wisdom and kindness,\" she wrote. \"His capacity to fell you with a look or lift you with a word. The intransigence made him the great artist he was\u2014his ineffable and cynical wit, the clarity with which he saw most things, including me, and the fact that he never spared me the view. I learned a lot from him.\"PHOTOS: The best\u00a0Harry Potter movie moments everShe continued, \"He was the finest of actors and directors. I couldn't wait to see what he was going to do with his face next. I consider myself hugely privileged to have worked with him so many times and to have been directed by him. He was the ultimate ally. In life, art and politics. I trusted him absolutely. He was, above all things, a rare and unique human being and we shall not see his like again.\"Rickman's family released a statement to break the tragic news. \"The actor and director Alan Rickman has died from cancer at the age of 69. He was surrounded by family and friends,\" it read.His final film, Alice Through the Looking Glass, hits theaters in May. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Rickman's family. Here are more reactions from his\u00a0Harry Potter co-stars: I was at Leavesden Studios today when I heard the news. As I walked through the canteen I thought of Alan queuing up for his lunch with us mere mortals. I recalled the trailer in which he offered me some of the greatest advice I ever received about this mad profession we shared. Being back in those corridors made me remember a lot of things and I will treasure those memories all my life. He inspired my career more than he ever knew and I'll miss him.A photo posted by Matthew Lewis (@realmattdavelewis) on Jan 14, 2016 at 7:07am PST\"I am devastated to hear about the passing of Alan Rickman, I feel so privileged to have had the opportunity to work with him on numerous occasions- Even though he has gone- I will always hear his voice,\"\u00a0Rupert Grint tells E!

He had that rare ability to shift the energy of a set the moment he walked on. I will never forget his deep, measured and theatrical voice. He will be missed by the Potter family.\"\"Sidestepped by the awful news today,\" Jason Isaacs says.\u00a0\"The polar opposite of the icy, manipulating characters he became best known for, Alan was hilarious, warm-hearted and fabulous company. To witness the laser-like honesty of his acting in the flesh was a rare privilege.
