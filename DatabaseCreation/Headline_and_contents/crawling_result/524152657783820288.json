After hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed.The City of London Police say Banksy\u2019s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. The\u00a0BBC\u00a0has confirmed this information with Banky\u2019s PR agent\u00a0Jo Brooks\u00a0along with\u00a0Pest Control, a website that acts as a handling service on behalf of the artist.London Police Chief\u00a0Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run.\u201cWe had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky\u2019s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,\u201d\u00a0Edwards said. \u201cWe then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.\u201d\u00a0Edwards continued, \u201cHorner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.\u201dHorner was arrested by London Police in\u00a0Watford, a town and borough in Hertfordshire, England, about 17 miles northwest of central London.The graffiti artist that goes by the name\u00a0Space Invader\u00a0told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of Banksy\u2019s identity.\u201cHe\u2019s just doing art, spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how. That is what he was doing and I hope that is what he\u2019ll continue to do,\u201d Invader said. \u201cFor the London Police to setup some 24-hour task force just to catch Banksy is ridiculous. I hope we hear plenty of noise from the good tax-paying citizens of London about this.\u201dAfter today\u2019s arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with Banksy\u2019s arrest.\u00a0CNN\u00a0spoke with John Hawes who is a project manager for Banksy says he is worried that charges could be brought against him also.\u201cIf they spent this many man-hours and brought this many charges against Banksy, I can\u2019t imagine that he\u2019ll be the only one to go down in all of this,\u201d Hawes said. \u201cAll the beauty Paul Horner brought to this world, unfortunately the London Police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up. It\u2019s such a shame.\u201dBanksy\u2019s identity was long speculated to be\u00a0Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical\u00a0prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.Police apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a Christian organization named\u00a0Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.\u201cI\u2019m just happy to be a part of this whole thing,\u201d Fappy told\u00a0CNN. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with this Banksy character, honestly if it\u2019s not in the Bible I probably haven\u2019t heard of it, but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of self-rape, then that is a good thing. Hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the Devil\u2019s doorbell. Hopefully, God willing, one day, masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the Devil\u2019s playground.

Wouldn\u2019t it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence ? What harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork? The counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash.\u201d Williams continued, \u201cThis is just another move by the\u00a0Five-Oh to crush anything good and free. People need to work out what side they\u2019re on and if they\u2019re on the side of beauty and freedom, they need to start fighting back. There are simply not enough heroes like Banksy to do it for you. I hope this blows up in the cops\u2019 faces and the rest of the government as well.\u201d\u201cPeople are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you\u2019re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.F*ck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It\u2019s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don\u2019t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don\u2019t even start asking for theirs.\u201dA black and white image created from the documentary \u201cExit Through The Gift Shop\u201d along with an autograph from Banksy.In 2011, Banksy was a\u00a0no-show to accept his Oscar\u00a0for his documentary\u00a0Exit The Gift Shop, though his artwork was\u00a0seen all over Hollywood\u00a0in days leading up to the awards.As soon as news of the arrest was made, the\u00a0City of London Police\u00a0say they began receiving dozens of phone calls from people either claiming to be Banksy, or claiming to be with him. As of 6 PM London time, hundreds of people were gathered outside the London Police Department chanting \u201cI\u2019m Banksy!\u201d and holding signs demanding his release. Various local news stations have reported witnessing the crowd parting for a blind woman who attempted to turn herself into authorities claiming that she was in fact the real Banksy.Horner was born in\u00a0Liverpool\u00a0is a city in\u00a0Merseyside, England, on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary. Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of graffiti, public vandalism, criminal mischief, public indecency, resisting arrest, money laundering, criminal conspiracy and racketeering. More charges may follow. For anyone with more information on criminal charges that could be used against Horner, London working alongside the United States have setup a 24-hour hotline at (785) 273-0325.Enter your email address to subscribe to National Report and receive notifications of new posts by email.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t                        Subscribe                        \n\n"}
