Paiute band leaders do not want their help, and are outraged at the disruption of their traditional lands by a racist terror-cell.\nRegarding the wildlife refuge, the Burns Pauite Indian tribe and federal government officials said they were worried about possible damage to cultural resources, artifacts, sensitive records and local wildlife habitats.\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service strongly condemned the occupiers for building the new road.\n\"It's deplorable,\" spokesman Jason Holm said in an email. \"I'm not sure what part of the [occupiers'] interpretation of the constitution promotes the destruction and desecration of culturally significant Native American sites \u2026 This is disgusting, ghoulish behavior.\"\nHolm also said the fish and wildlife service had received reports that the occupiers were accessing federal records at the refuge, raising concerns about a possibly dangerous data breach. He said the government was now contracting with a data protection and credit monitoring service to safeguard refuge employees whose personal data may have been compromised.\n\nOregon militia's behavior increasingly brazen as public property destroyed\n [Sam Levin/The Guardian]\n\n(Image: Amanda Peacher)\n\n(Image: Amanda Peacher)\n\n\n\nMore word from the ongoing attempt to bring the people responsible for years of CIA torture to justice: one of the three waterboarding specialists at Guantanamo was called \"The Preacher\" because while he was drowning suspects to the point of near death, he \"would at random times put one hand on the forehead of a\u2026 READ THE REST\n\n\n\n\nProperty of the People (previously) used Freedom of Information Act requests to force the Department of Homeland Security to reveal that it tracks members of the Valve Turners \u2014 a nonviolent environmental group that practices civil disobedience against oil pipelines \u2014 alongside of white nationalist mass-murderers and killers like Dylan Roof (the mass murderer behind\u2026 READ THE REST\n\n\n\n\nLast week, a drone video showing hundreds of people in China being shackled and blindfolded and made to kneel on a train platform went viral; a piece of amazing digital detective work by Nathan Ruser presents a compelling case that the video is real, and that it was recorded in August 2018 near the city\u2026 READ THE REST\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, electronics customers have griped about the high cost of their precious tech marvels.
