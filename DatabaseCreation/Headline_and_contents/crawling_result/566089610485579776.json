Senator Thomas Corbin \u2013 a \u201cRepublican\u201d from Travelers Rest, S.C. \u2013 offered some bizarrely sexist commentary on the role of women in the political process.Corbin\u2019s comments \u2013 made at a legislative dinner held in downtown Columbia, S.C. \u2013 were reportedly directed at S.C. Senator Katrina Shealy, the only female member of the 46-person State Senate.According to multiple witnesses who attended the dinner \u2013 held at Cowboy Brazilian Steakhouse on Main Street (a few blocks from the S.C. State House) \u00a0-Senate judiciary committee members were discussing the CDV issue,\u00a0which has been a source of several previous headaches for the GOP.That\u2019s when Corbin \u2013 no stranger to making\u00a0bizarre statements \u2013 \u00a0is said to have begun needling his lone female colleague regarding her gender.\u201cI see it only took me two years to get you wearing shoes,\u201d Corbin told Shealy, who was elected in 2012 as a petition candidate.Wait \u2026 what?By way of explanation, lawmakers and legislative staffers have previously told FITS about statements made by Corbin \u2013 statements reflecting his belief that\u00a0women do not belong in the S.C. General Assembly and should instead be \u201cat home baking cookies\u201d or \u201cbarefoot and pregnant.\u201d\u201cHe makes comments like that all the time to everybody\u00a0\u2013 including Senator Shealy,\u201d one Senate staffer told FITS.Corbin\u2019s latest comments took his sexism to a whole new level, though.At one point in the conversation \u2013 which quickly escalated\u00a0into a confrontation \u2013 Shealy is said to have angrily asked Corbin where he \u201cgot off\u201d attacking women.His response \u2013 overheard by numerous lobbyists and fellow lawmakers \u2013 was one for the ages.\u201cWell, you know God created man first,\u201d Corbin said, reportedly smirking at Shealy. \u00a0\u201cThen he took the rib out of man to make woman. \u00a0And you know, a rib is a lesser cut of meat.\u201dUmmmm \u2026 \u00a0wow.Calls to Corbin\u2019s office were not immediately returned, but sources close to the 50-year-old \u00a0lawmaker tell FITS his comments were part of a \u201crunning joke\u201d between him and Shealy.\u201cHe\u2019s just needling her \u2013 he don\u2019t mean nothing by it,\u201d the source said.KATRINA SHEALYShealy declined to discuss the matter with FITS \u2013 citing its irrelevance to the legislative matter under discussion \u2013 but sources at the event tell FITS Corbin did not appear to be joking. \u00a0Furthermore, they added that if there really was a \u201crunning joke,\u201d Shealy clearly wasn\u2019t in on it.\u201cShe got in his face,\u201d one lobbyist who attended the event said of Shealy\u2019s reaction, adding that at one point \u201cwe thought we were going to have to hold her back.\u201dWow \u2026 good for her.Shealy has been an incredibly substantive, consistently pro-free market reformer ever since she\u00a0defeated former S.C. Sen. Jakie Knotts \u2013 a fiscally liberal, \u00a0\u201cRepublican\u201d \u2013 in 2012. \u00a0She\u2019s taken principled stands for taxpayers \u2013 and even taken on her former ally governor Nikki Haley when she thought it was right.We like her \u00a0\u2026 not because she\u2019s a woman, but because she\u2019s a\u00a0solid Senator who is strong on the issues that ought to matter to Palmetto State citizens.As for Corbin? \u00a0He\u2019s got a decent voting record, but the first-term lawmaker continues to marginalize himself by saying ridiculous things in public.Maybe he\u2019s joking, maybe he isn\u2019t \u2026 and he\u2019s obviously got a right to speak his mind like the rest of us \u2026 but Corbin needs to recognize right quickly that the fight for expanded individual liberty and economic prosperity is (and always should be) blind to questions of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other determining characteristic that\u2019s got nothing to do with a person\u2019s views on the issues.Otherwise he will continue to be nothing but a sideshow at the S.C. State House \u2026 one with a serious problem heading into the 2016 election cycle.@fitsnews Gee, I wonder off the top of my head, if I could discern his political affiliation.\u2014 Darth Skeptic (@weakSquare) February 11, 2015@fitsnews I thought for a moment there that Will was bucking for Jon Stewart's job\u2026 But it's apparently for real\u2026\u2014 Brad Warthen (@BradWarthen) February 11, 2015@weakSquare @fitsnews This is why we can't have nice things in SC.\u2014 George R.
