Despite this, he was receiving welfare payments and had a gun license.During the news conference, Abbott announced that federal and New South Wales officials would be conducting a review of how Monis evaded authorities.Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott gives a press conference with New South Wales Premier Mike Baird at The Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices on Dec. 16, 2014, in Sydney, Australia.Abbott held a Tuesday afternoon press conference conceding that despite the \"terror alert level\" being set to \"High\" and the gunman being on bail, Mon Haron Monis wasn't on the AFP&#39;s list.Even though Monis was \"well known\" to authorities, Abbott said he didn&#39;t \"believe he was on a terror watch list at this time.\"\"There was nothing consistent about this individual&#39;s life, except that he was consistently weird,\" he added.But Abbott &mdash; flanked by state and federal policing authorities &mdash; insisted that even if Monis had been on such a list, he might not have been picked up by authorities before Monday.\"Even if this individual had been monitored 24 hours a day, it&#39;s quite likely, certainly possible, that this incident could have taken place,\" he said.Discussing the siege, the prime minister said: \"This has been an absolutely appalling and ugly incident, that&#39;s the only way to describe it. Our hearts go out to the families of Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson. It&#39;s about as innocent a thing as anyone can do.\"To go and grab a morning coffee before the working day has truly started. Decent innocent people who got caught up in the sick fantasy of a deeply disturbed individual.\"The tragedy of these times is that there are people even in a society such as ours who wish to do us harm. We are not immune to the politically motivated violence which has for so long stalked other countries.\"Abbott also played tribute to the New South Wales authorities&#39; handling of the situation: \"Everyone has been impressed by the speed of the NSW response, the thoroughness of the preparations they made and the professionalism of the action they took once it became obvious that people inside the cafe were being taken out by this deluded and sick individual.\"I think every Sydneysider can feel quietly proud of the way this city has handled one of the most difficult 36 hours in our history.\"New South Wales Premier Mike Baird expressed anger that Monis had been granted bail: \"We&#39;re all outraged that this was guy was on the street. I&#39;m incredibly upset. I&#39;m outraged!\"Premier Baird also announced he&#39;d be willing to toughen bail laws pending a complete review and Prime Minister Abbott left the terror alert level set to \"High\".Cafe manager Tori Johnson&#x27;s family releases statement to @BenFordham: &#x22;We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori&#x22;Mark Di Stefano@MarkDiStefFollowCafe manager Tori Johnson's family releases statement to @BenFordham: \"We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori\"12:20 PM - 16 Dec 14ReplyRetweetFavoriteCafe manager Tori Johnson's family releases statement to @BenFordham: \"We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori\"Breaking: Injured list released from @nswpolice... three women with gunshot wounds.

Katrina, together with two other members of the NSW Bar, were held as hostages during the incident at the Lindt Caf&eacute; in Phillip Street, Sydney, yesterday.Katrina was one of our best and brightest barristers who will be greatly missed by her colleagues and friends at the NSW Bar. She was a devoted mother of three children, and a valued member of her floor and of our bar community.

But one has to be careful to look at the precise matters and facts that were put before the court at the point in time that bail was granted.\"Conditsis said he was offended by \"inappropriate\" questions as to whether his \"conscience was clear\" for securing bail for Haron Monis.A bouquet is pictured under police tape near the cordoned-off scene of a hostage-taking at Martin Place after it ended early Dec. 16.Australian newspapers and their front page headlines this morning #sydneysiegeBridie Jabour@bkjabourFollowAustralian newspapers and their front page headlines this morning #sydneysiege2:21 PM - 15 Dec 14ReplyRetweetFavoriteAustralian newspapers and their front page headlines this morning #sydneysiegeTwo hostages, a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman, were killed in the ensuing raid, as was the suspected 50-year-old gunman, who has been identified by police as Man Haron Monis.Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione told a press conference that teams of officers made the decision to enter the caf&eacute; with volley of flash grenades in order to save hostages.\"They made the call because they believed at that time if they didn't enter there would have been many more lives lost,\" Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said.A number of hostages managed to flee the caf&eacute; before the police went in at 2:10 a.m. local time.For the first time, police also released a figure for the total number of people who were taken hostage in the Lindt Chocolate Caf&eacute; in Martin Place on Monday morning.\"We have accounted for, at this stage, 17 hostages,\" Scipione said. \"That includes the five that escaped yesterday and a number that have been caught up with, some with traumatic injuries, some with medical conditions.\"Scipione said the police have launched a detailed investigation into what he termed \"a critical incident.\"\"Unbelievably overnight, we have lost some of our own in an attack we never thought we would see here in our city,\" Baird said. \"In the past 24 hours, this city has been shaken, by a tragedy that none of us could have ever imagined.\"\"The values we held dear yesterday we hold dear today,\" he said. \"They are the values of freedom, democracy, and harmony. These defined us yesterday, they will define us today, they will define us tomorrow.\"The alleged gunman, Man Haron Monis, was among those killed during the shoot-out. He was pronounced dead after being taken to hostage, police said in a statement.The two hostages killed were a 34-year-old male and a 38-year-old woman.One woman was taken to hospital with a gunshot wound to her shoulder, while two other women were being treated for \"non-life threatening injuries.\" A male police officer also suffered a \"non-life threatening wound to his face from gunshot pellets.\"The police statement does not detail how many people in total had been inside the caf&eacute; throughout the course of the stand-off.Here&#x27;s the police press release.
