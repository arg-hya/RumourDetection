And he rented a Manhattan apartment, though his parents, immigrants from the Bengal region of South Asia, won\u2019t let him move out of the house yet.Still, the cherubic prodigy is living, and dreaming, large.\u201cWhat makes the world go round?\u201d Islam asked in the interview, explaining his preference for trading and investment over startups. \u201cMoney. If money is not flowing, if businesses don\u2019t keep going, there\u2019s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.\u201dIslam and a pair of other young, Wall Street wolf-cub buddies eat regularly at hot spot Morimoto, where they enjoy $400 caviar and fresh-squeezed apple juice.They hope to start a hedge fund in June, after Islam turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license.\u201cMo\u2019s our maestro,\u201d one of the kids explained.The three pals intend to make a billion dollars by next year. All while attending college. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about the money,\u201d Islam told the mag, which ranked his spectacular success story as No. 12 in its 10th annual \u201cReasons to Love New York\u201d issue.\u201cWe want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.\u201cLike the Koch brothers,\u201d he added, referring to sibling oil magnates Charles and David, worth $40 billion each.Islam\u2019s biggest inspiration, though, is Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge-funder and private asset manager from Connecticut who ranks as the 108th-richest American, according to Forbes.Battered by losses, Jones would jump back in the game again and again. It was a lesson Islam found instructive when, while dabbling in penny stocks at age 9, he lost a chunk of the money he\u2019d made tutoring. Islam swore off trading, realizing, \u201cI didn\u2019t have the balls for it,\u201d he said.We want to create a brotherhood \u2026 who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.Fortunately, he turned to studying modern finance, reading up on the titans of trading and ultimately finding inspiration in Jones. \u201cI had been paralyzed by my loss,\u201d Islam remembered of his 9-year-old self.\u201cBut [Jones] was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over,\u201d he said.And while Islam still needs to rely on Dad to chauffeur him on inspirational drives past the magnate\u2019s Greenwich mansion, he\u2019s quick to quote from the guru whom he credits with getting him back in the game and making him \u201cwho I am today.\u201d\u201cPaul Tudor Jones says, \u2018You learn more from your losses than from your gains.\u2019\u2009\u201dShare Selection"}
