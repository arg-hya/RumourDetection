According to park director Jacob Bartlett, Ordeal Kingdom\u2019s specialized combination of features will ensure a slowly building resentment among visiting families, eventually resulting in a dramatic public outburst followed by a silent walk back to the car.\u201cWe\u2019ve considered every detail to ensure parents and their kids have the heated argument of a lifetime,\u201d said Bartlett, explaining that the park was split into five themed \u201clands,\u201d including Fatigue Island and Hunger Lagoon, each of which can be reached by Mickey\u2019s Congestion Junction Railway. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the sheer distance between rides or the unspecified bathroom locations, every aspect of the experience is guaranteed to ratchet up the tension until you and your family are screaming at each other and saying you should never have come in the first place.\u201d\u201cNo trip to Disney is complete without everyone in your party losing all emotional self-control,\u201d Bartlett continued. \u201cAnd at Ordeal Kingdom, we promise that all your wildest family blowups will come to life!\u201dAccording to Bartlett, considerable effort was devoted to crafting the park\u2019s overall aesthetic, which emphasizes open, unshaded stretches of asphalt without any benches for resting. Additionally, no lockers have been provided anywhere on the grounds, encouraging guests to carry their bags and souvenirs around with them all day, often over stretches of quaint, uneven cobblestone.Bartlett went on to add that the Disney FastPass service will be available in the new park, giving irritable visitors the opportunity to squabble over whether they wasted their no-wait ride selection too early in the day.One of Ordeal Kingdom\u2019s most popular attractions is expected to be Tarzan Adventure, a kid-friendly obstacle course that provides dozens of opportunities for parents to lose track of their children among twists and turns as they struggle to make their voices heard over loud jungle sound effects. Park officials explained that the design is intended to sow seeds of resentment toward whichever parent insisted that the attraction\u2019s deliberately vague age requirements could be ignored, contributing to the eventual fiery altercation that officials expect to boil over at an understocked gift shop or a snack stand selling $11 soft pretzels.\u201cWe provide the rides, games, and entertainment, and you do the rest\u2014whether you opt to loudly belittle your spouse on the teacups ride or wait until you\u2019re in your hotel room later that night to call your 8-year-old son an ungrateful little shit, Ordeal Kingdom is perfect for families of all kinds,\u201d said Bartlett, raising his voice over the park\u2019s theme song, which blares on a continuous loop from loudspeakers throughout the entire property. \u201cWho knows? Maybe your family will have that special Disney shouting match as soon as you enter the park, right after you shell out 75 bucks for your daughter\u2019s ticket only to have her scream right in your face that she hates you.\u201dOfficials noted that Ordeal Kingdom also features live shows on five different stages, each one tailored to appeal exclusively to one gender and age group, with all shows occurring simultaneously once per day during lunchtime. In addition, the property hosts a number of three-hour-long parades throughout the day that can be viewed from designated obstructed viewpoints.Furthermore, sources confirmed that numerous Disney characters, all from the 1985 movie The Black Cauldron, would be wandering the park for visitors to meet and take photos with.\u201cWe want your family to have a one-of-a-kind experience while you\u2019re here, which is why Disney employees will be on hand throughout the park to wish you \u2018a magical day,\u2019\u201d said Bartlett, referring to the greeting that will begin to sound more and more like a taunt as the afternoon wears on. \u201cPlus, as one final treat, you\u2019ll find the parking lots completely unmarked, providing one last special opportunity for family members to cry, yell, and pitch a hysterical fit\u2014regardless of how young or old they are\u2014when it takes more than an hour to find the car!\u201dAdded Bartlett, \u201cOur goal is to leave every one of our guests with memories that will last a lifetime.\u201d"}
