Self-described 'f***ing fat ugly virgin' and bodybuilder Jake Davison (centre), 22, murdered his mother Maxine (left), 51, after bursting into her home in the Devon city with a pump-action shotgun last night. Without saying a word Davison, dressed in black, then gunned down the girl and a male relative, 43, walking her up Biddick Drive before then shooting and injuring a man and a woman nearby. They are recovering in hospital. The gunman then shot and murdered a dog walker aged 61 in a nearby park, and fatally wounded a woman, 59, outside a hair salon - before shooting himself 'during that six-minute-or-so period' before armed police arrived. Today, it was claimed his mother Maxine begged the NHS and police to give him urgent mental health treatment during lockdown - and it was also revealed he was still allowed to hold a valid gun licence. The murders which took place at about 6pm yesterday came 22 days after he was bragging online about the UK 'having more guns you think' in a post about US-style mass shootings. Also pictured (bottom right): On a Reddit thread, under the question 'What do incels think of their mother', Davison replied: 'Can't stand her'.\u00a0\n      \n      \n      Military veteran MPs, many of whom served in the country, blasted the decision to send some 600 soldiers back to evacuate UK nationals still there, as the Islamic extremists' march continued. Friday saw the Taliban capture another four provincial capitals in southern Afghanistan as the insurgents press a lightning offensive that is gradually encircling the capital Kabul. Militants seized Pol-e Alam - the provincial capital of Logar - which lies 30 miles south of Kabul, according to a local official. They also captured the key cities of\u00a0Lashkar Gah - the capital of the southern province of Helmand - earlier on Friday, and the capitals of Kandahar and Herat\u00a0on Thursday, tightening the group's grip on the country. Former army officer and ex-defence minister Tobias Ellwood invoked Winston Churchill - the PM's political hero - after the evacuation deployment was announced. Ellwood, chairman of the defence committee, said on Twitter: 'What would Churchill say? This is NOT our finest hour. What happened to GLOBAL BRITAIN and AMERICA IS BACK? The largest high tech military alliance ever - defeated by an insurgency armed with mines, RPGs and AK47s. We can and must do better.'\n    \n        \n        Kadian Nelson, 26, who previously pleaded guilty to rape, kidnap and threats to kill, assaulted the 13-year-old while she made her way to school in Mitcham.\n    \n        \n        A serving West Mercia Police officer and a three-year-old child were found dead today at an address in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the force said.\n    \n        \n        A simmering dispute between 27-year-old Jade Valentine, of Plymouth, Devon, and the other mother began when one child patted another's backside.\n    \n            \n            Journalist Amanda Ruggeri (pictured left with her daughter) was driving back to her home in north Cornwall from Newquay at around 7pm on Sunday, May 2 when her 12-week-old became distressed and had a 'total meltdown'. Her partner pulled in at the earliest opportunity and parked\u00a0at the Newquay Golf Club car park, which she said was empty, for 21 minutes while she fed the little one. But weeks later the couple received a ticket from Smart Parking Ltd, which managed the club's car park, for \u00a3170 for being parked 'illegally'. They appealed, pointing out that in their distress they hadn't noticed signs (right) that said they couldn't park there, but their application was rejected last month. Speaking to CornwallLive , Amanda said their baby had suddenly become very distressed in the car and they had no idea if she was having 'some kind of health incident'.\n        \n        \n        Damion Simmons, 45, had posted sexual photographs of Denise Keane-Simmons, 36, before he broke into her house in Alric Avenue, Harlseden, poured petrol on her and set it on fire.\n    \n        \n        Janice D'Aguilar, 54, Zeno Sharif, 29, Isaiah Thompson, 29, and Gemma Green, 35, were told they were 'extremely fortunate' not to be jailed after taking advantage of drunk man in Manchester.\n    \nNEW\n\n        Benjamin Teague, 26, was killed alongside his 18-year-old female passenger when his BMW was in collision with a Volkswagen ID4 at 9.10pm last Monday on the A5 in Northamptonshire.\n    \n        \n        Artificial intelligence was used by researchers from Yale University in Connecticut to scan the tweets of more than 7,000 individuals and see how levels or moral outrage changed with time.\n    \n       \n       EXCLUSIVE: Jake Davison, 22, a bodybuilder who appears obsessed with not being attractive to women, has been named by people in the Devon naval city as the gunman with a three-year-old girl feared to be among his victims. At 6pm last night the apprentice crane operator was seen shooting indiscriminately before kicking down the door of a house in Biddick Drive, a few doors from his own home,\u00a0and opening fire with a long-barreled gun on the people inside, believed to be members of his family. His rampage left the young girl, two women, and two men dead. More were injured. The mass shooting\u00a0\u00a0- the first in Britain involving an 'active gunman' for 11 years - will spark an inquiry into how Davison was able to get the weapon in a country with strict gun controls. 'Home Secretary Priti Patel was briefed throughout the evening as was Boris Johnson, who today tweeted;\u00a0My thoughts are with the friends and family of those who lost their lives and with all those affected by the tragic incident in Plymouth last night.

Today MailOnline can reveal he was an active YouTuber calling himself 'Professor Waffle', who posted videos of himself working out and most recently ten-minute rants about life being 'rigged against you', humanity being on the 'brink of extinction' and being repulsive to the opposite sex. In his most recent online rant from his bedroom he said: 'You wake up and you stare at the wall and you're thinking um nothing's changed but I'm still in the same position, same period in life, still a f***ing this, that virgin f***ing fat ugly, what'.

'The final report will be compiled, but effectively the case will be seen as closed.' Details of the autopsy were sent to the French prosecutor investigating her death and Esther's boyfriend Dan Colgate who found her body earlier this week.

The United Nations begged on Friday for neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to allow people to escape the Taliban, and U.N. agencies warned of a growing humanitarian catastrophe amid spreading hunger. Afghanistan's government has now effectively lost control of most of Afghanistan to the Taliban, following an eight-day blitz into urban centres by the group. With just three cities remaining under government control\u00a0- including the capital of Kabul - thousands of people are making a last ditch attempt to flee the country. But as people fled on foot with nothing but the clothes on their back, the nephew of Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani was seen on Instagram taking a different approach - escaping on a private jet (pictured bottom-inset).
