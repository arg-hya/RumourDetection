He was 40.It would be difficult to make the case that Walker was a particularly influential or exceptional actor. But he was a fine action star and was decent in his heavier dramatic fare. But beyond his on-screen credentials, all available evidence suggests that Walker was, up until the moment he died, a celebrity who genuinely cared about the world around him\u2014someone who used his celebrity for worthy causes.According to a statement posted to the actor\u2019s Facebook fan page, Walker died \u201cin a tragic car accident while attending a charity event for his organization Reach Out Worldwide.\u201dReach Out Worldwide, formed by Walker in 2010, is a 501(c)(3) that provides rescue and recovery aid in the wake of major natural disasters. The group supplements rescue efforts with its own team of paramedics, doctors, and search-and-rescue professionals. Reach Out Worldwide has lent its services to disaster-relief efforts in the Philippines, Alabama, Indonesia, Chile, and Haiti. \u201cI\u2019d made a few runs into Port-au-Prince and was negotiating with the army to give me baby formula, tents, extension cords,\u201d Walker told the Daily Telegraph, an Australian tabloid newspaper, in 2011. \u201cI was hustling for everything.\u201dHere\u2019s his explanation for why he started Reach Out Worldwide:Because of my travels with work and pleasure, a lot of the times disasters would strike in areas that I\u2019d been. You think of the faces\u2014they might not be people you\u2019re in contact with but you can\u2019t help but wonder how that family was you had dinner with. That stuff starts crossing your mind and you feel so helpless. I would be consumed with anger, like, \u201cFuck! I wanna be there, I wanna do whatever I can.\u201d One of my best friends had heard it too many times and ultimately he just held me accountable. He punked me out: \u201cSo you gonna pack your bags and go to Haiti and help out or what?\u201d\u201cWhen the shit hits the fan,\u201d Walker continued, \u201cthat\u2019s when you actually see the best in people.\u201dHours, one of the last films Walker starred in, is scheduled for a mid-December release. It\u2019s a fitting send-off for Walker: The film is set in a hospital in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, with Walker playing a father desperately trying to protect his newborn daughter.Here\u2019s a clip of Walker and the Fast & Furious 7 cast encouraging fans to help victims of Typhoon Haiyan:\u00a0Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.By signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.Mother Jones was founded as a nonprofit in 1976 because we knew corporations and the wealthy wouldn't fund the type of hard-hitting journalism we set out to do.Today, reader support makes up about two-thirds of our budget, allows us to dig deep on stories that matter, and lets us keep our reporting free for everyone.
