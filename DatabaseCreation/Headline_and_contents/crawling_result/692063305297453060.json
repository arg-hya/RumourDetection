According to Broderic, despite years of working individually with such students during lunch and after school, urging them to submit to the school\u2019s literary magazine when they didn\u2019t think they were talented enough, and even helping pay for their school supplies when their families could not afford to do so, she had \u201cabsolutely fucking zilch\u201d to show for it.Broderic confirmed to reporters that none of the students she has championed over the years has returned to campus to tell her she changed everything.\u201cI thought I had it in the bag with Zack Keeler back in 2003,\u201d Broderic said. \u201cWhen I first read his amazing Gatsby essay, I thought, this kid is really going to deliver. I\u2019m going to give him some extra attention, and he\u2019s going to get out of his tough neighborhood, maybe become a writer himself someday. Nope. Dropped out junior year and was cleaning pools last I heard. Completely crapped out on me.\u201d\u201cI lent him my copy of Letters To A Young Poet,\u201d said Broderic, a book she said greatly inspired her decision to become an educator. \u201cHe just drew samurai swords in the margins.\u201dAccording to Broderic, other disappointments included a student from Honduras who didn\u2019t speak English until he was 7, a pregnant teenager who also worked a full-time cashier job, and a girl who had barely uttered a word since her father died\u2014all of whom, despite Broderic\u2019s dedicated mentoring, had \u201cflamed out completely\u201d before the year was even over.\u201cYou know, maybe next year I\u2019ll just pick a name out of a hat,\u201d Broderic said. \u201cI honestly couldn\u2019t do any worse.\u201d"}
