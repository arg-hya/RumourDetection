{"id": "507242819623587841", "headline": "Tesla chooses Nevada for battery factory: Sources", "content": " Tesla has finally decided that it  will build its $5  billion lithium-ion battery plant\u2014dubbed  the gigafactory\u2014in Nevada, sources  say.  \"That's a go, but they are still negotiating the specifics of the  contract,\" a source within the Nevada's governor's office told  CNBC on Wednesday afternoon. The source noted that it could be a  week before the deal is official.       Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval will hold a news  conference on Thursday in Carson City to make  a \"major economic development announcement,''  according to a media advisory from the state.  Tesla spokesman Simon Sproule declined to  give details but confirmed Tesla officials  would be at the event. In July, the automaker announced that it had partnered  with Japanese electronics firm Panasonic to build the 35  GWh cell factory. It also said it would announce additional  partnerships in the coming months. Analysts at Lux Research expect the  \"gigafactory\" to reduce the cost of the Tesla Model 3 by  $2,800, which it says is \"not enough to sway the success of the  planned lower-cost EV.\"   Tesla also considered California, New Mexico, Arizona and  Texas as possible locations for the factory.\u2014CNBC.com staff.
