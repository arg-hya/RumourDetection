Some supported him and recognized his creative frustrations; others essentially inferred he was dead to them. And when \"Pillowtalk\" arrived, the reactions came flooding in -- divided as always.https://twitter.com/emphaticzayn/status/693079141600628736https://twitter.com/Iarrysupdates/status/693064075476123648https://twitter.com/1DsUniverse/status/693059049068351488https://twitter.com/enlighthes/status/693049579701272577https://twitter.com/trippyxlou/status/692934856460861441https://twitter.com/1DsUniverse/status/693057351595728897https://twitter.com/twxrking_larry/status/693072426612187136https://twitter.com/NikiRacks/status/692960672464924673https://twitter.com/dspeev/status/692967813410111491https://twitter.com/ohlittlerachel/status/692938963661766657https://twitter.com/JAKOLARRYz/status/693049022257328128"}
