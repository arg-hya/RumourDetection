And 2016 is expected to smash the record again, according to the Met Office, with the global surface temperature rising to 0.84 \u00b0C.Global warming is, of course, the main reason why the record for the warmest year keeps being broken. Every year the planet as a whole is accumulating more heat energy as a result of rising greenhouse gas levels.The vast majority of this heat goes into the oceans rather than the lower atmosphere. Just how much varies from year to year, largely because of the natural phenomenon known as the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a cycle.During La Ni\u00f1as, cold surface waters in the Pacific soak up even more heat than usual, which can cool the lower atmosphere and thus lower surface temperatures. During El Ni\u00f1os, warm surface waters in the Pacific release a little heat, warming the lower atmosphere.We are currently in the middle of what is by some measures the strongest El Ni\u00f1o ever recorded, which is why global surface temperatures have shot up so much. Many other factors, from the solar cycle to levels of aerosol pollution in the atmosphere, also have a role.As New Scientist revealed in July, we are already halfway to 2 \u00b0C \u2013 the level countries decided it would be dangerous to exceed.Average global surface temperatures have now risen by more than 1 \u00b0C compared with pre-industrial times, according to all the main records of global surface temperatures, including those compiled by the UK\u2019s Met Office, and by NASA and NOAA in the US.These records differ slightly because of the way they handle regions where there are no weather stations, like most of the fast-warming Arctic. The Met Office record simply excludes these regions \u2013 and thus likely underestimates global warming \u2013 while the others extrapolate the missing data by various methods.Even if countries stick to the climate change commitments they made at the UN climate summit in Paris in November last year, the world is currently on track to warm by 3 or 4 \u00b0C by 2100. That is the most likely outcome for the estimated amount of emissions, but the resulting warming could be less than this, or as much as 5 or 6 \u00b0C.Read more: \u201cOases of cool: Taking the heat out of urban living\u201cMore on these topics: "}
