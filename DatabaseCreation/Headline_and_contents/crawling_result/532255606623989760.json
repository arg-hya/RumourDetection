Follow him on Twitter @IncilinShare This StoryFive days ago, a Reddit user uploaded a photo of a list of words banned at the\u00a0Chick-fil-A\u00a0he works at. The list was complied by Eric, the store's manager, and included words and phrases typically found in rap songs like \"on fleek,\" \"fam,\" and \"bout a week ago.\"Apparently, Eric had heard enough slang from his staff and felt it didn't reflect\u00a0the values of the popular restaurant chain. It's worth noting the the store's founder,\u00a0Samuel Truett Cathy, was known as a deeply religious\u00a0Southern Baptist which is why Chick-fil-A stores are always closed on Sundays.As much as it sucks that their impeding on the rights of workers to use slang, we'd much rather have employee meals than have the right to say \"bae.\"\u00a0[via Reddit]Join the conversation on Complex today!Share This Story"}
