Just give me several hours by myself to watch Modern Family, the Vikings game, Die Hard 2, and three back-to-back episodes of Man V. Food in peace. That doesn\u2019t sound too hard to me.\u201d Sanborn added that he deserves a little time to himself during the week, as he barely gets 16 hours per day to watch television over the weekend."}
