Bill Haslam, Mayor Megan Barry and other officials during her 9:30 a.m. visit to McGavock, according to a statement from the White House. Ted Mitchell,\u00a0U.S. undersecretary of education, and Randy Boyd, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, also will attend.The visit comes as the\u00a0U.S. Department of Education is accepting applications for a new experiment that will invest up to $20 million to improve high school students'\u00a0access to college coursework, the White House statement said. The funding will allow up to 10,000 high school students from low-income families\u00a0to use federal grants for dual-enrollment college courses during\u00a0the 2016-17 academic year.While in Nashville, Jill Biden also will host\u00a0a meeting\u00a0of the College Promise National Advisory Board, a bipartisan panel that advocates for free\u00a0community college and improved college access. Boyd, who was\u00a0a dominant force in the formation of Tennessee Promise\u00a0and Haslam's Drive to 55 effort to increase the number of Tennesseans with a college education, is a member of the board.Tennessee has become a national leader in college access in recent years, largely because of Tennessee Promise, the first statewide\u00a0scholarship program in the country to\u00a0offer\u00a0graduating high school seniors the chance to attend community or technical college tuition-free.\u00a0Biden visited the state in 2015 along with President Barack Obama to celebrate what he called \"the great work that's been done\" in Tennessee.State leaders also have invested in dual-enrollment programs, which bring college-level courses to high schools.\u00a0A $10 million grant program that rolled out in late 2014 put college-level\u00a0mechatronics in high schools in Montgomery County and other school systems across the state.According to a December report from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission,\u00a01,591 high school students\u00a0took dual-enrollment college courses that were funded or enhanced by the\u00a0Labor Education Alignment Program\u00a0grants.\u00a0The same report\u00a0urged lawmakers to provide added funding and attention during this year's legislative session.Reach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and on Twitter @tamburintweets."}
