If you were to walk into an empty room, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed him\u2026He was a little odd, a little strange in the way he carried himself. But we [at the mosque] never made anything of it.\u201dNolan first started attending\u00a0ISGOC\u00a0in May.While Mohammed denies that his mosque encourages radicalization, he revealed that\u00a0Moussaoui\u00a0also attended ISGOC.\u00a0Mohammed recalled Moussaoui\u00a0expressing a dislike towards\u00a0non-Muslims.\u00a0\u201cI lectured a class that day, and [Moussaoui] said he disagreed with non-Muslims being in the Mosque,\u201d Mohammed said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pay any attention because that\u2019s just how some people think. But you know, look what happened. So we\u2019re going to try to monitor for [strange behavior] more.\u201dAt this point, however, it is unclear how ISGOC monitors alarming behavior.\u00a0Massaoui, who is a French citizen,\u00a0is currently serving a life sentence\u00a0without parole in Colorado.\u00a0FBI reports\u00a0show that in early 2001, Massaoui displayed odd, alienating behavior at ISGOC; he approached Suhaib Webb,\u00a0the mosque\u2019s former Imam, and asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell the Muslims they should leave the land of the Infidel?\u201dWebb himself, and his history of radicalization, has also raised eyebrows. Webb, who now serves as Imam of the sister organization of the mosque\u00a0attended\u00a0by\u00a0the Boston Bomber suspects,\u00a0has ties to former Al Qaeda mastermind Anwar al-Awlaki.\u00a0\u201cWe do have people here who have an extreme way of thinking,\u201d Mohammed admitted. \u201cWhat I mean by that is [they think], \u2018The way I practice Islam is right, you\u2019re wrong. My school of thought is the best, your\u2019s is a little shaky.\u2019 We have that.\u201dStill, he insisted that \u201cdown with America\u201d mindsets are not present at the mosque. \u00a0Referring to the recent incident involving Nolen, Mohammed said, \u201cThis is not something that\u2019s going to be widespread. We\u2019re going to keep our eye out for this.\u201dHe added, though, that \u201cit\u2019s impossible to completely stop\u201d violence, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know what people are thinking.\u201dFollow Kristin Tate on Twitter\u00a0@KristinBTate.\u00a0Border / Cartel ChroniclesBeheadingIslam.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Protect Yourself From Big Tech!Thank You!Copyright \u00a9 2021 Breitbart"}
