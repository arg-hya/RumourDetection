Peter Wohlleben had found what he was looking for: a pair of towering beeches. \u201cThese trees are friends,\u201d he said, craning his neck to look at the leafless crowns, black against a gray sky. \u201cYou see how the thick branches point away from each other? That\u2019s so they don\u2019t block their buddy\u2019s light.\u201dBefore moving on to an elderly beech to show how trees, like people, wrinkle as they age, he added, \u201cSometimes, pairs like this are so interconnected at the roots that when one tree dies, the other one dies, too.\u201dMr. Wohlleben, 51, is a very tall career forest ranger who, with his ramrod posture and muted green uniform, looks a little like one of the sturdy beeches in the woods he cares for. Yet he is lately something of a sensation as a writer in Germany, a place where the forest has long played an outsize role in the cultural consciousness, in places like fairy tales, 20th-century philosophy, Nazi ideology and the birth of the modern environmental movement.After the publication in May of Mr. Wohlleben\u2019s book, a surprise hit titled \u201cThe Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate \u2014 Discoveries From a Secret World,\u201d the German forest is back in the spotlight. Since it first topped best-seller lists last year, Mr. Wohlleben has been spending more time on the media trail and less on the forest variety, making the case for a popular reimagination of trees, which, he says, contemporary society tends to look at as \u201corganic robots\u201d designed to produce oxygen and wood.PRESENTING scientific research and his own observations in highly anthropomorphic terms, the matter-of-fact Mr. Wohlleben has delighted readers and talk-show audiences alike with the news \u2014 long known to biologists \u2014 that trees in the forest are social beings. They can count, learn and remember; nurse sick neighbors; warn each other of danger by sending electrical signals across a fungal network known as the \u201cWood Wide Web\u201d; and, for reasons unknown, keep the ancient stumps of long-felled companions alive for centuries by feeding them a sugar solution through their roots.\u201cWith his book, he changed the way I look at the forest forever,\u201d Markus Lanz, a popular talk show host, said in an email. \u201cEvery time I walk through a beautiful woods, I think about it.\u201dThough duly impressed with Mr. Wohlleben\u2019s ability to capture the public\u2019s attention, some German biologists question his use of words, like \u201ctalk\u201d rather than the more standard \u201ccommunicate,\u201d to describe what goes on between trees in the forest.But this, says Mr. Wohlleben, who invites readers to imagine what a tree might feel when its bark tears (\u201cOuch!\u201d), is exactly the point. \u201cI use a very human language,\u201d he explained. \u201cScientific language removes all the emotion, and people don\u2019t understand it anymore. When I say, \u2018Trees suckle their children,\u2019 everyone knows immediately what I mean.\u201dStill No. 1 on the Spiegel best-seller list for nonfiction, \u201cHidden Life\u201d has sold 320,000 copies and has been optioned for translation in 19 countries (Canada\u2019s Greystone Books will publish an English version in September). \u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest successes of the year,\u201d said Denis Scheck, a German literary critic who praised the humble narrative style and the book\u2019s ability to awaken in readers an intense, childlike curiosity about the workings of the world.The popularity of \u201cThe Hidden Life of Trees,\u201d Mr. Scheck added, says less about Germany than it does about modern life. People who spend most of their time in front of computers want to read about nature. \u201cGermans are reputed to have a special relationship with the forest, but it\u2019s kind of a clich\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Scheck said. \u201cYes, there\u2019s Hansel and Gretel, and, sure, if your marriage fails, you go for a long hike in the woods. But I don\u2019t think Germans love their forest more than Swedes or Norwegians or Finns.\u201d MR. WOHLLEBEN traces his own love of the forest to his early childhood. Growing up in the 1960s and \u201970s in Bonn, then the West German capital, he raised spiders and turtles, and liked playing outside more than any of his three siblings did. In high school, a generation of young, left-leaning teachers painted a dire picture of the world\u2019s ecological future, and he decided it was his mission to help.He studied forestry, and began working for the state forestry administration in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1987. Later, as a young forester in charge of a 3,000-odd acre woodlot in the Eifel region, about an hour outside Cologne, he felled old trees and sprayed logs with insecticides. But he did not feel good about it: \u201cI thought, \u2018What am I doing? I\u2019m making everything kaput.\u2019\u00a0\u201dReading up on the behavior of trees \u2014 a topic he learned little about in forestry school \u2014 he found that, in nature, trees operate less like individuals and more as communal beings. Working together in networks and sharing resources, they increase their resistance.By artificially spacing out trees, the plantation forests that make up most of Germany\u2019s woods ensure that trees get more sunlight and grow faster. But, naturalists say, creating too much space between trees can disconnect them from their networks, stymieing some of their inborn resilience mechanisms.Intrigued, Mr. Wohlleben began investigating alternate approaches to forestry. Visiting a handful of private forests in Switzerland and Germany, he was impressed. \u201cThey had really thick, old trees,\u201d he said. \u201cThey treated their forest much more lovingly, and the wood they produced was more valuable. In one forest, they said, when they wanted to buy a car, they cut two trees. For us, at the time, two trees would buy you a pizza.\u201dBack in the Eifel in 2002, Mr. Wohlleben set aside a section of \u201cburial woods,\u201d where people could bury cremated loved ones under 200-year-old trees with a plaque bearing their names, bringing in revenue without harvesting any wood. The project was financially successful. But, Mr. Wohlleben said, his bosses were unhappy with his unorthodox activities. He wanted to go further \u2014 for example, replacing heavy logging machinery, which damages forest soil, with horses \u2014 but could not get permission.After a decade of struggling with his higher-ups, he decided to quit. \u201cI consulted with my family first,\u201d said Mr. Wohlleben, who is married and has two children. Though it meant giving up the ironclad security of employment as a German civil servant, \u201cI just thought, \u2018I cannot do this the rest of my life.\u2019\u201dThe family planned to emigrate to Sweden. But it turned out that Mr. Wohlleben had won over the forest\u2019s municipal owners.So, 10 years ago, the municipality took a chance. It ended its contract with the state forestry administration, and hired Mr. Wohlleben directly. He brought in horses, eliminated insecticides and began experimenting with letting the woods grow wilder. Within two years, the forest went from loss to profit, in part by eliminating expensive machinery and chemicals. Despite his successes, in 2009 Mr. Wohlleben started having panic attacks. \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018Ah! You only have 20 years, and you still have to accomplish this, and this, and that.\u2019\u201d He began therapy, to treat burnout and depression. It helped. \u201cI learned to be happy about what I\u2019ve done so far,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a forest, you have to think in terms of 200 or 300 years. I learned to accept that I can\u2019t do everything. Nobody can.\u201dHe wanted to write \u201cThe Hidden Life of Trees\u201d to show laypeople how great trees are.Stopping to consider a tree that rose up straight then curved like a question mark, Mr. Wohlleben said, however, that it was the untrained perspective of visitors he took on forest tours years ago to which he owed much insight.\u201cFor a forester, this tree is ugly, because it is crooked, which means you can\u2019t get very much money for the wood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really surprised me, walking through the forest, when people called a tree like this one beautiful. They said, \u2018My life hasn\u2019t always run in a straight line, either.\u2019 And I began to see things with new eyes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
