Before his appointment as sergeant-of-arms,\u00a0Vickers\u00a0was director of security operations for the House of Commons.The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament Buildings.Vickers's brother John, who lives in Victoria,\u00a0told CBC News Wednesday that his brother called their mother,\u00a0Monica, at her New Brunswick\u00a0home shortly after the incident to tell her he is safe.\u00a0\"I just couldn't be prouder of him right now,\" John said, adding that his brother has \"always been committed to service, people and country.\"\u00a0When asked about Vickers\u2019s reported heroics, his cousin Keith said \u201cIt\u2019s Kevin being Kevin.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a very intelligent and responsible person. He\u2019s a people person-type fellow, too, but you don\u2019t want to mess with him,\u201d said Keith. \u201cAll the boys, the local guys, they\u2019ll be quite proud to hear he did what he did.\u201dAccording to Keith, Vickers\u2019s son is currently a police officer with the local force in Miramichi.Dan Bussi\u00e8res, the current sergeant-at-arms in the New Brunswick Legislature and Vickers\u2019s colleague in the RCMP for many years, called him \u201ca true gentleman who is very responsible.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the perfect man to be the sergeant-at-arms in Ottawa right now. I can assure you of that,\u201d Bussi\u00e8res\u00a0said.\u00a0Prior to his appointment in the House of Commons, Vickers worked as an aide-de-camp for New Brunswick's former lieutenant-governor,\u00a0Marilyn Trenholme Counsell.Vickers served under Trenholme Counsell for four years starting in 1999. She watched closely Wednesday as reports came in about the shootings in Ottawa and news that Vickers may have played a central role in the events.Trenholme Counsell said she was not surprised to learn of his possible involvement.\"Not at all, it's so much in his character to take charge of something and do what has to be done,\" she said from her home as TV news reports played in the background.\"He is fearless in the face of a challenge. It didn't surprise me that he acted.\"As an RCMP officer, Vickers\u00a0was\u00a0responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.He is a recipient of the Queen's Jubilee\u00a0medal, the Canada 125 medal and the RCMP Long Service medal.\u00a0Former RCMP deputy commissioner Pierre-Yves Bourduas, who has also served as a security chief on Parliament Hill, called Vickers\u00a0a \"natural planner\" and said his former RCMP colleague has always \"had a contingency plan.\"\"He actually did mock-up scenarios for the personnel ... very much like what happened today,\" Bourdas\u00a0said. \"Knowing Kevin the way I do, he is very troubled by this chain of events.\"Although sergeants-at-arms often operate outside of the public spotlight, the events on Parliament Hill are not the first time they have been instrumental in preventing bloodshed in Canadian history.When army supply clerk Denis Lortie opened fire in Quebec's National Assembly in 1984, the legislature's sergeant-at-arms went into the chamber and tried to calm him.Rene Jalbert, a retired major in the army, offered Lortie a cigarette and eventually persuaded him to release about a dozen hostages who were cowering in the chamber.The legislature was minutes away from convening when Lortie entered the building through a side door carrying two submachine guns, and at one point sat in the Speaker's chair firing wildly. He killed three people and wounded 13 others.On mobile?
