Jackson Mark The Start Of Shooting For The MarvelsBatman. Superman. Doomsday. It\u2019s safe to say that both Gotham and Metropolis\u2019 skylines are in danger of being drastically rearranged again in Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice. The two great DC superheroes are the twin cover stars of this month\u2019s Empire. Inside is reams of coverage and world-first pictures from the blockbuster, a few of which we\u2019re able to debut right here.Kicking off is Henry Cavill\u2019s flying Kal-El trailing blazing destruction behind him. Not only will Superman and Batman be clashing, but their alter egos, Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne, will also be at loggerheads: one a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist; the other, an investigative journalist on the trail of Gotham\u2019s Bat-shaped vigilante. It will end badly for someone.Click to enlarge images.\u201c[Batman] is not giving people a chance,\u201d explains producer Charles Roven. \u201cHe is more than a vigilante. He has become not only the cop, if you will, he has also become the jury and executioner.\u201d Here he\u2019s also a man with very glowy eyes.For his part, the Dark Knight is experiencing his own share of (dark k)nightmares. The picture below shows the horrors now haunting the psyche of a character who, Roven stresses, will be markedly different from the Christian Bale iteration. \u201cHe\u2019s older,\u201d stresses the producer, \u201c[and] he\u2019s seen the worst of what man can do. He\u2019s been darkened by it, he\u2019s tougher, he\u2019s angrier, I guess.\u201d There\u2019s no Rachel to grieve here, but, adds Roven, \u201che\u2019s still lost those that are near and dear to him, and not necessarily from old age or disease.\u201dThere\u2019s a new threat in town too. One with Balrog-like bulk and Hulk-esque power. \"To go up against heroes like Batman and Superman, we wanted to introduce one of the DC Universe\u2019s most iconic and powerful villains,\u201d elaborates director Zack Snyder. \"He is essentially an unstoppable force. He poses a real threat to the world within the film.\u201dBatman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice arrives in UK cinemas on March 25. For much, more more on it in the meantime pick up the new issue of Empire on February 28.
