Render them unto the state. We're better for them than parents or daycare. \r\rhttp://t.co/tczjYLEvgs\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014Initially tried to sell universal pre-K as a way to get kids ahead.\r\rNow they're going for the \"these damn kids are in my way\" crowd.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014\"Sometimes, someone, usually Mom, leaves the workplace to stay home with the kids, which then leaves her earning a lower wage for the rest..\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014\u2026of her life as a result.

Both parents working means tax revenue, kids in state pre-K is control.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014I'm lucky that I don't have to work and get to stay home with my kids. I'm well aware of the lasting effect it will have on future earnings.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014Don't condescend to me about my choices. Wife and I chose them. We sacrificed some things so that we may have others. That's called \"life\".\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014Obama can go fuck a pineapple, the condescending prick.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014It is a lie. It is the biggest lie told to children & immature adults that you can have everything without sacrifice. Biggest lie ever told.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014Most people lap up these promises, are perpetually unhappy because reality strikes back, and then blame others for their imperfect lives.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014Grow the fuck up. You can't have everything but you can be happy. The first step is prioritizing and making a fucking decision.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014Oh, we have a generation of people who aren't equipped to do that? Color me shocked. Wonder why that is.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014God damn does this garbage infuriate me.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014\"I shouldn't have to\u2026 Why must I?\"\r\rWe live in a world of adult children incapable of making decisions out of refusal of responsibility.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014Take ownership of your life & your choices. Don't like them? Make better ones. Stop demanding people eliminate the need to choose & grow up.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014Do you really want the state making choices for you? Do you really want them creating a one size fits all world?\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014The more you rely on the government, the more it owns you.\u2014 Halloween drunk (@Peetweefish) October 31, 2014Trending"}
