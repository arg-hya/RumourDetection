Zika: What you need to knowZika was first detected in Uganda in 1947, but has never caused an outbreak on this scale.Brazil reported the first cases of Zika in South America in May 2015.Most cases result in no symptoms and it is hard to test for, but WHO officials said between 500,000 and 1.5 million people had been infected in the country. The virus has since spread to more than 20 countries in the region.At the same time there has been a steep rise in levels of microcephaly - babies born with abnormally small heads - and the rare nervous system disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome.The link between the virus and these disorders has not been confirmed, but Dr Chan said it was \"strongly suspected\" and was \"deeply alarming\".And she warned the situation could yet deteriorate as \"this year's El Nino weather patterns are expected to increase mosquito populations greatly in many areas\". The BBC's David Shukman, reporting from Recife in north-east Brazil, said doctors were \"overwhelmed\" by cases of microcephaly.One hospital in the city had gone from dealing with an average of five cases a year to 300 in the past six months.Earlier, doctors writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association said Zika had \"explosive pandemic potential\" and said the WHO's failure to act swiftly on Ebola probably cost thousands of lives.In a statement to the executive board meeting of the WHO, Dr Chan said: \"The level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty. \"Questions abound - we need to get some answers quickly.\"For all these reasons, I have decided to convene an Emergency Committee.\"I am asking the Committee for advice on the appropriate level of international concern and for recommended measures that should be undertaken in affected countries and elsewhere.\" Officials from the US National Institute of Health said they had two potential Zika vaccines in development. One that is based on an experimental West Nile vaccine could be repurposed for Zika and enter clinical trials by the end of 2016, Dr Anthony Fauci from NIH said. He said talks were already taking place with pharmaceutical companies, but a vaccine would not be widely available for several years. Meanwhile Dr Anne Schuchat, from the Centers for Disease Control confirmed there had been 31 cases of Zika in the country - all linked to travel to the affected areas.At a news conference, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the country's response to the virus so far had been \"consistent with the kind of threat that could be out there\".\"At this point, here in the United States, the risk of a disease spread by mosquitoes is quite low, the January temperatures in North America are quite inhospitable to the mosquito populations.\"\"But, obviously that's going to change,\" he added.Dr Carissa Etienne, the regional-director for the WHO Pan American Health Organization, said the link between the abnormalities and Zika had not been confirmed.But she added: \"We cannot tolerate the prospect of more babies being born with neurological and other malformations and more people facing the threat of paralysis.\"Follow James on Twitter.Zika: What you need to know'The worst day of my life'Zika 'could become explosive pandemic'How mums-to-be are tackling ZikaZika outbreak: What you need to knowDiplomats hasten exit as Taliban near KabulUS troops arrive to help with evacuation efforts as militants seize a city an hour's drive from Kabul.July was Earth's hottest month ever - US agencyBBC condemns expulsion of journalist from Russia'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car'Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedomsWill Biden's biggest call yet also be his most calamitous?The female Afghan journalist who won't give up.
