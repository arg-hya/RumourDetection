He spoke about adopting a more R&B-influenced sound. He pursued an edgier aesthetic. He craved authenticity and creative control. And damn it, he wanted to sing about sex.Well, turns out he really wasn\u2019t kidding about that last bit. Despite the forewarning that this was going to be a \u201cdirty and raw\u201d debut, Zayn\u2019s first solo single, \u201cPillowtalk,\u201d eclipses all expectations for just how libidinous his music could be. The loud, sexy track has F-bombs and heavy beats galore, but Zayn's vocals stand front and center, shining on one hell of a towering chorus.Zayn released \u201cPillowtalk\u201d and its accompanying video late Thursday night, less than 24 hours after revealing the title of his upcoming album, Mind Of Mine, in an interview with Beats 1. In that same interview, the 23-year-old was curiously tight-lipped about his rumored girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, murmuring something about being \u201cgood friends.\u201d But, uh, you can go ahead and squash any leftover doubts you may have had about their coupledom, because #Zigi is here. #Zigi is now. In the vid, Zayn and Gigi navigate a kaleidoscopic paradise and war zone, where they make out, make up and cry black tears as Zayn sings, \"So we'll piss off the neighbors/ In the place that feels the tears/ The place to lose your fears/ Yeah, reckless behavior/ A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw/ Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day/ F--king you, and fighting on/ It's our paradise and it's our war zone.\"In an interview with Sunday Times Culture magazine earlier this week, Zayn described \u201cPillowtalk\u201d as \u201cso pure, so dirty and raw\u201d (little did we know he was actually quoting the song at the time), adding that he\u2019s not glazing over its explicitly sexual theme.\u201cI think I'm pretty black and white about what it's about,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has sex, and it\u2019s something people wanna hear about. It\u2019s part of everybody\u2019s life, a very big part of life! And you don\u2019t wanna sweep it under the carpet. It has to be talked about.\u201dThough \u201cPillowtalk\u201d is the first full single we\u2019ve heard from Zayn, a snippet of a new song called \u201cBefour\u201d was previously featured in a video accompanying his Fader magazine profile. Both tracks are expected to appear on Mind Of Mine, which is due to arrive March 25 (exactly one year after leaving 1D)."}
