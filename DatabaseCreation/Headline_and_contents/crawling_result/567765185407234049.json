That was nixed when Facebook users pointed out that the name of their event is more widely associated with the Ku Klux Klan hate group in the USA than it is with Krispy Kreme Klub. Perhaps the person in charge didn't know the white supremacist group, due to it starting in the former\u00a0Kolonies.A spokeswoman for the Hull branch of Krispy Kreme said that the flyers were\u00a0\u201csent from the head office, so it has been advertised at all the outlets.\" The week of festivities is aimed at kids who are on half-term holidays from school. They can decorate donuts however hatefully and insensitively\u2014without fear of local law enforcement intrusion\u2014as they'd like.\u00a0Krispy Kreme\u00a0has apologized and is launching an investigation into who named the event.
