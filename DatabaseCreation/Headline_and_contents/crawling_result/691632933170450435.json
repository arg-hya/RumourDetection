No one\u2019s ever said that about me before. If this thing gets big enough, I might even see some people on Twitter and TV calling me a hero\u2014that would feel good.\u201d Norris added that it would probably also be a nice little boost when the 12 members of his jury take less than an hour to declare him not guilty."}
