{"id": "519131101798100992", "headline": "Hewlett-Packard Confirms Plans To Split In Two, Cut An Additional 5,000 Jobs", "content": "Computer and printing giant Hewlett-Packard said Monday morning that it plans to split into two separate publicly traded companies, confirming the speculation that broke out over the weekend. The company also confirmed its plan to cut another 5,000 jobs and pledged to invest the money saved from the lower headcount into research and development. Wall Street is cheering the news, sending the stock for a more-than 5% gain in early Monday trading.By the end of 2015, the HP of today will no longer exist; the tech giant will split itself into one company focused on servers, software and cloud technology, and one company focusing on the legacy computers and printers business. The cloud-focused company, to be named Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, will be led by current CEO Meg Whitman; the computer-and-printer-focused business will be named HP Inc and led by\u00a0Dion Weisler, who is currently serving as executive vice president of HP's printing and personal systems business.\u00a0Whitman will serve as non-executive chairman of HP Inc's board of directors.HP Inc will retain HP's existing logo, the company said, and current HP shareholders\u00a0will own shares of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc once the split is complete. (The transaction should be tax-free for federal income tax purposes, HP noted.)\"The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan.\u00a0It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders,\" Whitman said in a statement Monday morning. \"In short, by transitioning now from one HP to two new companies, created out of our successful turnaround efforts, we will be in an even better position to compete in the market, support our customers and partners, and deliver maximum value to our shareholders.\"As Hewlett-Packard Enterprise focuses on developing cloud services, HP Inc will focus its efforts and investments on developments in computing and 3-D printing.\"This is a defining moment in our industry as customers are looking for innovation to enable workforces that are more mobile, connected and productive while at the same time allowing a seamless experience across work and play,\" Weisler said in a statement Monday morning, adding that HP Inc is positioned to do just that.In the statement confirming the impending split, HP also reaffirmed its financial outlook for full-year 2014 results, saying that it expects to record non-GAAP earnings between\u00a0$3.70 and $3.74 per share. For fiscal 2015, HP is projecting full-year non-GAAP earnings per share between\u00a03.83 and $4.03. Neither outlook includes the one-time charges that the company expects to incur from the separation of businesses.\"HP\u2019s balance sheet is in the strongest shape it has been in the past\u00a0several years with cash greater than debt, PC margins are very stable, and services\u00a0margins are improving,\" wrote Citi analyst Jim Suva in a research note Monday morning. Suva has HP rated as a buy with a $40 price target, but said that break-up could provide additional upside to the stock price.\u00a0\"This allows the company more financial flexibility. We also\u00a0note the stock market has been embracing spin outs with recent news from eBay\u00a0(spin out PayPay), etc,\" Suva said.In an investor presentation on its website, HP also provided shareholders with an update on its restructuring plans: in addition to the previously-announced 45,000 to 50,000 total employee reductions, HP will cut another 5,000 jobs. By the time the restructuring program is complete, HP will have cut its headcount by 55,000 positions.Shares of HP soared in Monday's pre-market trading session on the confirmation of the separation plans and job cuts; the stock was up more than 5% as the opening bell approached. Year-to-date, shares have gained more than 27%.Maggie McGrath is  the editor of ForbesWomen, the Forbes vertical dedicated to covering all angles of female entrepreneurship.
