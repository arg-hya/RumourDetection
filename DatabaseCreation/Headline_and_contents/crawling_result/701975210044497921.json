Race    http://fus.in/21lRyK2Copied to clipboardThe Sanders campaign is sticking to its guns and insisting that it won the Latino vote in Nevada\u2014a claim contested by the Clinton camp following the former Secretary of State\u2019s win in that state\u2019s democratic primary last Saturday.An analysis of publicly available voter data distributed to the press by the Sanders campaign concluded that the Clinton camp has \u201cno statistical basis\u201d to back claims that it won most of the Latino vote in Nevada. It maintains that support from young voters helped Sanders win \u201cthe Latino vote.\u201dBoth campaigns are hungry to prove their proposals are resonating with Latino and other nonwhite voters. Though Sanders lost Nevada, it was the first battleground state where Latino voters played a significant role. Claiming victory with Latino voters there could boost either candidate\u2019s chances of solidifying Latino support in other key states.Soon after caucuses closed in Nevada on Saturday, the Bernie Sanders campaign sent a statement to journalists declaring Sanders had won the state\u2019s Latino vote.Ultimately Hillary Clinton carried the state by 5.3%, but the Sanders campaign stressed the vote returns show their campaign is gaining traction with Latinos and other non-white voters.\u201cWhat we learned today is that Hillary Clinton\u2019s firewall with Latino voters is a myth,\u201d Arturo Carmona, deputy political director for the Sanders campaign, wrote in the statement sent to the press. \u201cAccording to entrance polls Sanders won among Latino voters by 8 points,\u201d read the email. But those numbers may not add up. Clinton won about 60% of delegates in areas with a heavy Latino population, according to The New York Times, a figure that raises questions about the credibility of the entrance polls cited by the Sanders campaign.UPDATE: In Nevada's Latino-majority precincts, Clinton won 207 delegates and Sanders won just 130. Proves entrance polls were wrong.\u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) February 21, 2016The Times cited a report, issued by a leading research group that focuses on Latinos, showing that \u201cMrs. Clinton was victorious in the majority of the 40 precincts in Nevada that have more than 50 percent Latino registrants.\u201d Given that dominance, the entrance polls cited by Sanders \u201cdo not add up,\u201d according to the report from Latino Decisions for the Clinton campaign. The Sanders campaign is discrediting the methodology used by Latino Decisions.\u201cThe methodology of using heavily Latino or \u2018barrio\u2019 precincts to represent Latino voting behavior has been considered ineffective and discarded for more than 30 years due to non-barrio residential patterns common among Latino voters since the 1980\u2019s,\u201d said Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, president of the William C. Velasquez Institute (WCVI), a nonpartisan Hispanic research and public policy organization in San Antonio.\u201cSimply put there is no relevant statistical inconsistency between Edison\u2019s Entry Poll results for Latinos, Whites, and Blacks and the overall election results. Based on this fact WCVI concludes that there is no statistical basis to question the Latino vote breakdown between Secretary Clinton and Sen. Sanders.\u201dThe Sanders campaign says its findings are consistent with Latino voter patterns in other states.\u201cIt is not surprising that we received the support of the Latino community in Nevada, especially since the majority of those that turned out were young Latinos,\u201d said Erika Andiola, a Sanders spokeswoman. \u201cWe have consistently seen that the under-35 age group overwhelmingly supports Sen. Sanders, regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. It\u2019s also important to remember that young Latinos live all across Nevada and not just in Clark County.\u201dThe median age of all Latinos in Nevada is 26 years old, compared with a median age of 44 for whites and 33 for blacks, according to Census data.Here\u2019s what we do know: Nevada doesn\u2019t track voter registration or results by race, so both campaigns are making claims based on their best guesses. There isn\u2019t much evidence that Clinton won Latino voters by a landslide either. We also know that entrance polls are notoriously unreliable. In Iowa, for example, entrance polls projected a six-point margin of victory for Clinton when in fact she squeaked by on less than 1%. The entrance poll cited in the Sanders email had a margin of error of plus or minus seven points, according to The Washington Post.The Clinton campaign has been active in Nevada much longer than the Sanders campaign, with Clinton unveiling a glimpse into her immigration policy at a Las Vegas high school in May 2015.\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story reported the Sanders campaign commissioned the analysis released by the William C. Velasquez Institute. Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez released the statement on his own and the Sanders campaign distributed it to the media.\nClickto see local listings\u00a9 2021 Fusion Media Network, LLC.
