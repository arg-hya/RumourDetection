But that is not so,\u201d Francis said.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGetty\u201cThe Big Bang, which today we hold to be the origin of the world, does not contradict the intervention of the divine creator but, rather, requires it.\u201cEvolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve.\u201dThe Catholic Church has long had a reputation for being anti-science \u2013 most famously when Galileo faced the inquisition and was forced to retract his \u201cheretic\u201d theory that the Earth revolved around the Sun.Yet more recently, Benedict XVI and his close advisors have apparently endorsed the idea that intelligent design underpins evolution \u2013 the idea that natural selection on its own is insufficient to explain the complexity of the world. In 2005, his close associate Cardinal Schoenborn wrote an article saying \u201cevolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense \u2013 an unguided, unplanned process \u2013 is not\u201d.Giovanni Bignami, a professor and president of Italy\u2019s National Institute for Astrophysics, told the Italian news agency Adnkronos: \u201cThe pope\u2019s statement is significant. We are the direct descendents from the Big Bang that created the universe. Evolution came from creation.\u201dGiulio Giorello, professor of the philosophy of science at Milan\u2019s University degli Studi, told reporters that he believed Francis was \u201ctrying to reduce the emotion of dispute or presumed disputes\u201d with science.Despite the huge gulf in theological stance between his tenure and that of his predecessor, Francis praised Benedict XVI as he unveiled a bronze bust of him at the academy's headquarters in the Vatican Gardens.\u201cNo one could ever say of him that study and science made him and his love for God and his neighbour wither,\u201d Francis said, according to a translation by the Catholic News Service.\u201cOn the contrary, knowledge, wisdom and prayer enlarged his heart and his spirit. Let us thank God for the gift that he gave the church and the world with the existence and the pontificate of Pope Benedict.\u201dJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
