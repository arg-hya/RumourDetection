Aaron Vincent Elkaim/CPNHL commissioner Gary Bettman has said publicly that expansion isn\u2019t something the league has seriously considered, but a recent report says otherwise.According to The Vancouver Province\u2019s Tony Gallagher, an expansion team in Las Vegas is \u201ca done deal.\u201d \u201cSources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.\u201dWith a team in Las Vegas \u201call but assured,\u201d Gallagher also implies that talk of a Seattle expansion isn\u2019t without merit as many potential owners \u2013 including Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman \u2013 have shown plenty of interest.
