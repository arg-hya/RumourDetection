Relatives of 37 of the missing young people have provided DNA samples over the past several days and will be used to determine if the recovered remains belong to any of the students, the attorney said.The students have been missing since last week in violence that also resulted in six shooting deaths.The governor of Guerrero, \u00c1ngel Aguirre, said on Saturday that the victims had been \u201csavagely slaughtered\u201d.A group of protesters blocked a main highway in the state capital of Chilpancingo on Sunday demanding justice in the case. \u201cYou took them alive, we want them returned alive,\u201d read a huge planner across the road that links Mexico City with Acapulco.The father of one of the missing students expressed doubt that the remains belonged to the young people. He spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety.Another father, Acapulco street vendor Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez, whose 19-year-old son Giovani is among the missing, on Sunday was getting ready to participate in a protest in the Pacific coast resort and said he hoped the remains weren\u2019t those of the students.Other relatives \u201ctold us that [the remains] were burned, and that they couldn\u2019t be the kids,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. \u201cBut we\u2019re really nervous.\u201dAnger over the discovery of the graves exploded on Saturday night when a group of young people from the school protested outside the governor\u2019s Chilpancingo residence. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state authorities told them they would not allow them to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates.The Guerrero state prosecutor I\u00f1aky Blanco did not say on Saturday night how many bodies were in the burial pits uncovered on a hillside on Iguala\u2019s outskirts, and he declined to speculate about whether the dead were the missing students.\u201cIt would be irresponsible\u201d to jump to conclusions before tests to identify the bodies, Blanco said. Officials said the federal attorney general\u2019s Office and the National Human Rights Commission had sent teams of experts to aid state authorities in identifying the remains.About 100 soldiers, marines and federal and state police on Saturday cordoned off the area where the grave site was found in the poor Pueblo Viejo district of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200km) south of Mexico City.Blanco said eight more people had been arrested in the case, adding to the 22 Iguala city police officers detained after a police confrontation with student protesters last weekend set off a series of violent incidents in the city.The prosecutor has said state investigators had obtained videos showing that local police arrested an undetermined number of students after the initial clash and took them away.He said some of the eight newly arrested people were members of an organised crime gang, adding that some of them had given key clues leading to the discovery of the mass grave.Blanco said his investigators had found that \u201celements of the municipal police are part of organised crime\u201d. He also said his office was searching for the Iguala mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Abarca, and had alerted officials across Mexico to be on the lookout for him.The governor had charged earlier in the week that organised crime had infiltrated the city government.Violence is frequent in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.The Aytozinapa Normal school attended by the missing students, like many other schools in Mexico\u2019s \u201crural teachers college\u201d system, is known for militant and radical protests.State prosecutors have said the first of the recent bloodshed occurred on 26 September when city police shot at buses that had been hijacked by protesting students from a teachers college, killing three youths and wounding 25. A few hours later, unidentified masked gunmen shot at two taxis and a bus carrying a football team on the main highway, killing two people on the bus and one in a taxi."}
