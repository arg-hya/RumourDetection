When he  turned on his flashlight, he expected to see a small mammal, such as a  possum or a rat. \t\"When I turned on the light, I couldn't quite understand what I was  seeing,\" said Naskrecki, an entomologist and photographer at Harvard  University's Museum of Comparative Zoology. \tA moment later, he realized he was looking not at a brown, furry mammal, but an enormous, puppy-size spider.Known as the South American Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi),  the colossal arachnid is the world's largest spider, according to  Guinness World Records. Its leg span can reach up to a foot (30  centimeters), or about the size of \"a child's forearm,\" with a body the  size of \"a large fist,\" Naskrecki told Live Science. And the spider can  weigh more than 6 oz. (170 grams) -- about as much as a young puppy, the  scientist wrote on his blog. [See Photos of the Goliath Birdeater Spider] \tSome sources say the giant huntsman spider,  which has a larger leg span, is bigger than the birdeater. But the  huntsman is much more delicate than the hefty birdeater -- comparing the  two would be \"like comparing a giraffe to an elephant,\" Naskrecki said.The birdeater's enormity is evident from the sounds it makes. \"Its feet  have hardened tips and claws that produce a very distinct, clicking  sound, not unlike that of a horse's hooves hitting the ground,\" he  wrote, but \"not as loud.\" When Naskrecki approached the imposing creature in the rainforest, it  would rub its hind legs against its abdomen. At first, the scientist  thought the behavior was \"cute,\" he said, but then he realized the  spider was sending out a cloud of hairs with microscopic barbs on them.  When these hairs get in the eyes or other mucous membranes, they are  \"extremely painful and itchy,\" and can stay there for days, he said.

Although the  spider's bite is venomous, it's not deadly to humans. But it would still be extremely painful, \"like driving a nail through your hand,\" Naskrecki said. \tAnd the eight-legged beast has a third defense mechanism up its hairy  sleeve. The hairs on the front of the spider's body have tiny hooks and  barbs that make a hissing sound when they rub against each other, \"sort  of like pulling Velcro apart,\" Naskrecki said. \tYet despite all that, the spider doesn't pose a threat to humans. Even if it bites you, \"a chicken can probably do more damage,\" Naskrecki said.Despite its name, the birdeater doesn't usually eat birds, although it is certainly capable of killing small mammals. \"They will essentially attack anything that they encounter,\" Naskrecki said. \tThe spider hunts in leaf litter on the ground at night, so the chances  of it encountering a bird are very small, he said. However, if it found a  nest, it could easily kill the parents and the chicks, he said, adding  that the spider species has also been known to puncture and drink bird  eggs. \tThe spider will eat frogs and insects, but its main prey is actually  earthworms, which come out at night when it's humid. \"Earthworms are  very nutritious,\" Naskrecki said. \tBirdeaters are not very common spiders. \"I've been working in the  tropics in South America for many, many years, and in the last 10 to 15  years, I only ran across the spider three times,\" Naskrecki. \tAfter catching the specimen he found in Guyana, which was female,  Naskrecki took her back to his lab to study. She's now deposited in a  museum. Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitter and Google+. Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+.
