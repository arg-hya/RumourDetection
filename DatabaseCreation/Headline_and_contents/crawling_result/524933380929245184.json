{"id": "524933380929245184", "headline": "'Canada will never be intimidated,' Harper says after shootings in Ottawa", "content": "FOLLOW ON\n\tTwo \u201cdespicable attacks\u201d on Canadian soldiers this week will not weaken the country\u2019s resolve to fight terrorism at home and abroad, a sombre Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Wednesday.\n\tHarper addressed the nation hours after a young soldier was gunned down at the National War Memorial in Ottawa and dozens of shots fired inside Parliament ended with the shooter\u2019s death.\n\tThe attacks in Ottawa occurred just two days after a Quebec soldier was killed in what Harper called an Islamic State-inspired attack in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, not far from Montreal. The suspect in that case was killed by police after brief chase.\n\tHarper said more information about the \u201cterrorist\u201d killed in Ottawa will surface in the coming days. CTV News has confirmed that the suspect in Wednesday\u2019s attack is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian citizen born in 1982.\n\t\u201cThis week\u2019s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\t\u201cWe are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governments are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all,\u201d he said.\n\t\u201cBut let there be no misunderstanding -- we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.\u201d\n\tHarper said the attacks will only strengthen Canada\u2019s resolve and lead the government to \u201credouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home.\u201d\n\tNational Defence Minister Rob Nicholson echoed Harper in a statement issued late Wednesday, saying that Canada\u2019s deployments in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led fight against ISIS \u201cwill continue unimpeded.\u201d\n\tThe prime minister offered his condolences to the friends and family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the reservist who was \u201cmurdered in cold blood\u201d Wednesday while standing guard at the war memorial. Harper also praised the passersby and first responders who tried to save his life.\nOpposition Leader Thomas Mulcair called the shootings \"a cowardly attack designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, the heart of who we are.\"\n\tBut he said Canadians will once again wake up in a country \u201cblessed by love, diversity and peace.\u201d\n\tRCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a passport, and police were doing background checks. Zehaf-Bibeau was not on the list of \u201chigh-risk travellers\u201d being tracked by Canadian authorities, Paulson said.\n\tCourt records show that a Michael Joseph Zehaf-Bibeau was accused of robbery in Vancouver in late 2011. He was found guilty of uttering threats, a lesser charge.\nPanic on the Hill\n\tThe chaos in Ottawa began around 9:52 a.m. Wednesday, when police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting at the National War Memorial.\n\tWhen paramedics and police arrived, the honour guard -- later identified as Cirillo -- was on the ground, surrounded by people who tried to help him.\n\tA short time later, the gunman entered Parliament\u2019s Centre Block and dozens ofshots rang out as MPs, staff and reporters rushed to safety. The suspect was gunned down by Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons.\n\tThree other people were taken to the Ottawa Hospital after the shootings. They were all discharged by Wednesday evening.\n\tParliament Hill and Ottawa\u2019s downtown core were under lockdown for hours after the shootings, but police have not said if other suspects were still on the loose.\n\tOttawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said residents need to stay \u201cvigilant\u201d and report any suspicious activity to police. But he did not directly answer questions from reporters about the possibility that another shooter -- or shooters -- were still at large.\n\tEarlier Wednesday, Ottawa police Const. Marc Soucy said officers believe there may be more than one assailant. He said that police will be assuming that any other assailants are armed.\n\tTony Zobl, 35, told The Canadian Press that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor office window directly above the war memorial.\n\t\"I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph point-blank, twice,\" Zobl told CP.\n\t\"It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun. The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.\"\n\tZobl said he then saw the shooter run up the street toward Parliament Hill.\nVideo captured inside Parliament showed officers filing down the empty corridor of the Hall of Honour as at least a dozen shots could be heard ringing out in the background. A security guard was reported to be injured in the shooting.\n\t\u201cThis is a dynamic and unfolding situation,\u201d RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud told a news conference Wednesday afternoon.\n\tHe said the attack caught the RCMP by surprise, but would not elaborate.\n\t\u201cIf we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,\u201d he said.\n\tThe RCMP also said it\u2019s too early to say if the gunman was among the 90 or so suspected extremists being tracked by the Canadian government.\n\tReports of a third shooting inside the Rideau Centre, a shopping mall near Parliament Hill, turned out to be false, Bordeleau said.\n\t\u201cToday is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,\u201d Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said, adding that everyone is \u201clooking for answers.\u201d\n\tThe shooting comes two days after a man attacked two Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que. One of those soldiers, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, died from his injuries. The suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, was shot and killed by police.\n\tOn Tuesday, Canada raised the domestic terror threat level from low to medium.\nSecurity beefed up\n\tThe attack on Parliament Hill immediately prompted officials across the country to heighten security at government buildings, provincial legislatures and military bases.\n\tSoldiers are also being cautioned about wearing their uniforms in public when they\u2019re not on active duty.\n\tU.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Harper Wednesday and offered \u201cany assistance\u201d needed in the response to the attack, according to a tweet from the U.S. National Security Council.\n\tObama also expressed \u201cthe American people\u2019s solidarity with Canada,\u201d according to the NSC.\n\tThe president later publicly condemned the Ottawa shootings, calling them \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\t\u201cWe\u2019re all shaken by it,\u201d he said, adding that the U.S. is closely watching the unfolding events.\u00a0\n\tA statement from NATO\u2019s secretary general also said that \u201cNATO stands in solidarity with our ally Canada at this difficult time.\u201d\nWith files from Marlene Leung and The Canadian Press\nAn earlier version of this story Wednesday incorrectly reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was on a list of \u201chigh-risk travellers\u201d being tracked by Canadian authorities and had his passport seized.\nLive updates and commentary:\nOn mobile?
