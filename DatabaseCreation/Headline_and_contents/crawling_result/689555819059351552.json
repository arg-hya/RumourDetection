One of the American drones hit the car, and it is believed there was one other person in the vehicle.Mohammed EmwaziSource: Cage, London-based campaign groupCivil war erupted in Syria in 2011, and now President Bashar al-Assad's government, IS, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all hold territory.
