Buie (Southwest Research Institute); NASA; Phil PlaitThe very first nonsense I had to debunk in 2014 was a claim that on Jan. 4 of that year a planetary alignment would cause gravity to decrease, allowing you to float momentarily or fall more slowly if you jumped in the air at the right moment: \u201cZero G Day.\u201d This exact same hoax has resurfaced this week in a couple of places, so I\u2019ve decided to update the debunking to include some new links and repost it, hopefully to stem the tide of silliness at year\u2019s end. It seems fitting that (hopefully) this is also the last debunking I\u2019ll make in 2014. But who knows? There\u2019s still a week left.Something you\u2019ll never hear me say: \u201cWell, now I\u2019ve heard it all.\u201dLong experience has taught me there is\u00a0always\u00a0a sillier claim. Always. And you\u2019re hearing that from a guy who has debunked the ideas that\u00a0the Maya calendar predicted the end of the world, that\u00a0the \u201cSupermoon\u201d caused earthquakes, and that a magnetic pole flip of the Earth will cause superstorms\u00a0(and another saying the Earth is already physically starting to flip over).So what\u2019s sillier than these? Well, we now have the claim that early next year\u2014on Jan. 4, 2015 at 09:47 PST to be exact\u2014due to the combined gravity of Jupiter and Pluto, you will be able to jump in the air and float for just a couple of seconds (or at least fall more slowly, depending on different \u201csources\u201d).It\u2019s hard for me to overstate just how wrong this claim is. First off, this exact same hoax was pulled last year, in 2014, by a site called News Hound (now offline, apparently), and a lot of people fell for it. Here we are again, a year later, back at the same spot. This time the joke is being made by a \u201cnews\u201d site called Daily Buzz Live (which didn\u2019t even bother to change much of the wording of the original hoax). They even have a picture of a NASA tweet about the event:Photo from Daily Buzz LiveThere\u2019s only one problem: That picture is completely fake. NASA never tweeted it, and it was presumably made up wholesale for the article on Daily Buzz Live. Whoever did it was clever, adding the number of retweets and favorites, but it\u2019s as fake as a $20 iPhone you can buy on the street in New York City.After all, the physics of \u201cZero G Day\u201d is wrong, the claim about Pluto and Jupiter is wrong, and\u2014and this part is the real killer\u2014it\u2019s based on a joke made by an astronomer nearly 40 years ago!Despite this, it\u2019s spreading around Facebook (and\u00a0Twitter) so much once again that I got a lot of people asking or telling me about it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m debunking this thing again.So to get started, here\u2019s the claim:It has been revealed by the British astronomer Patrick Moore that, on the morning of January 4th 2014, an extraordinary astronomical event will occur. At exactly 9:47 am, the planet Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to the Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth\u2019s own gravity and making people weigh less. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.Yeah, except this is all baloney. To be polite. OK, so why is this wrong?Pluto and Jupiter, Sitting in a Tree \u2026First of all, the gravitational forces of the other planets in the solar system have essentially zero effect on you personally.And we\u2019re done. Full stop.OK, fine, I\u2019ll give some brief details. The planets are big objects with lots of gravity, but that only affects you if you\u2019re close to them. Space, however, is big\u2014that\u2019s why we call it space\u2014and planets are far away. This weakens their gravity on you hugely, reducing it to less than the impact of the flutter of a butterfly\u2019s wing.Photo by Shutterstock/Jaimie DuplassIf you want the math, then here you go:\u00a0Even if you add all of the planets together, they pull on you with a force less than 2 percent of that of the Moon! The Daily Buzz Live article mentions tides, too, but that\u2019s even worse: The combined tidal force from the planets is far less, like 0.005 percent of the Moon\u2019s! Simply put, the planets are just too far away to have any real effect on you. By the way, the Moon orbits the Earth on an ellipse, so its own gravity fluctuates far more than the combined strength of the planets every two weeks.Note that you cannot float in the air every two weeks.And specifically, the gravity from Pluto is weakest of them all. Pluto is a teeny tiny ice ball, far smaller than even our Moon \u2026 and at its closest it\u2019s flippin\u2019 4\u00a0billion\u00a0kilometers (2.5 billion miles) from Earth. That\u2019s a\u00a0long\u00a0way. A car on the road half a kilometer away has more gravitational pull on you than Pluto does.In fact, doing the math, I find that the Earth pulls on you about\u00a0200 trillion times harder\u00a0than Pluto does. That\u2019s about the same ratio as\u00a0the number of cells in your body\u00a0to a single cell \u2026 so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your arms.Location3It gets worse (amazingly). The article says Pluto will be \u201cdirectly behind Jupiter\u201d on Jan. 4, 2015. I checked: On that day they are on nearly opposite sides of the sky. They\u2019re really far apart, about 145\u00b0. You couldn\u2019t have picked a much\u00a0worse\u00a0date to claim Pluto was behind Jupiter.So the physics of the claim is ridiculous. But the origin of the claims makes it even funnier.Photo by Shutterstock/simekeshFool Me Once, Shame on YouThe article on Daily Buzz Live mentions that this claim came from\u00a0Patrick Moore. He was a real astronomer in the U.K., an enormously popular radio and television science program presenter\u2014he predated Carl Sagan and is still considered an icon of science in England.The wonderful thing about all this is: Moore actually did make this claim! However,\u00a0as Snopes.com points out, it was an April Fools\u2019 Day joke. Moore made this claim in 1976 on his radio program. To my complete unsurprise, apparently some folks called in to say they did feel the effect! This is called \u201cpriming,\u201d where you tell people in advance that they\u2019ll feel something due to some cause, and they will, even if the cause never happened. It\u2019s used by ghost hunters and ghost tour guides quite a bit, to spook people before they actually enter a \u201chaunted house,\u201d guaranteeing they\u2019ll feel chills as they walk from room to room. I\u2019ve seen this myself first hand: People can convince themselves of amazing things that never actually happened.Hope FloatsSo there you go: It\u2019s a repeat of a silly claim based on a joke in the first place.I know a lot of people reading this right now are slapping their foreheads and wondering how people can be so stupid as to fall for this. I understand this reaction, but I don\u2019t share it. Smart people fall for silly things all the time, and intelligence isn\u2019t really the prime factor here.Photo by Shutterstock/Glenn PriceSkepticism is. In general, schools don\u2019t teach people how to analyze a claim, how to tell if something makes sense on the surface of it, or how to go about looking into the claim. I knew right away to do the math, and to see if Pluto and Jupiter really were aligned as the article says. But all too often, people don\u2019t think carefully (or at all) about these claims, and simply spread them through social media. All it takes is literally the click of a \u201cShare\u201d button. Pseudoscience thrives via this virulence, whereas truth must take a harder path.In fact, that\u2019s why I bother debunking stuff like this. Sure, this is a silly claim, and probably harmless in practice. But not all of them are; I already mentioned the \u201cMayan Notpocalypse\u201d from 2012, and I can tick off a dozen other doomsday or scary claims that spread due to a lack of skepticism. And of course there are real issues like global warming denial, anti-vaccination, and more, which live and breathe and spread due to a lack of skepticism in the public.In my original post about this in January 2014, I said, \u201cThis particular bit of fluff will dry up and float away in a day or two, but those others are here to stay for a long time.\u201d I was wrong, and I should\u2019ve known that something like this would resurface again in a year; it\u2019s like the \u201cMars as big as the Moon\u201d nonsense that comes back year after year.Still, my hope is that every time we take a moment to inject a bit of (polite) skepticism into people\u2019s everyday lives, it makes the world a slightly better place to be.If enough of us do it often enough, we can change \u201cslightly\u201d to \u201cmagnificently.\u201dSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.All contents \u00a9 2021 The Slate Group LLC.
