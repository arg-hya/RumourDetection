A report in the Guardian subsequently deemed the story spurious.Kirchner\u00a0tweeted images of a small ceremony conducted with the family of Yair Tawil, the seventh child of an Argentine Jewish family, during which the Tawils\u00a0met with the president and lit candles on a menorah. She was adopting the child as her godson, a symbolic gesture made by generations of Argentine leaders over the years.According to the Independent,\u00a0tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf \u2014 known as \"el lobison\" in Argentina\u00a0\u2014 after his 13th birthday\u00a0and will stalk the night in its beastly form.\u00a0The legend\u00a0stems from indigenous\u00a0folklore and melded with superstitions of European settlers in the 19th century. The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started\u00a0the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.In the past half-century, the ceremonies have been opened up to girls and now, for the first time, Jews. The Tawil family appealed to the Argentine government as early as the 1990s to have the practice extended to\u00a0non-Catholic families. The boy's new status as the president's godson wins him a gold medal as well as a full educational scholarship, according to the Independent.Tales of shape-shifting demons and feral\u00a0monsters slaughtering livestock can be found in many parts of Latin America. This Argentine iteration can be traced to a local Guarani story\u00a0of the seven cursed spawn of Tau, an evil mythological spirit, and Kerana, a beautiful woman he seduced and kidnapped. The seventh son was \"Luison,\" who appears sometimes in the shape of a small dog and feeds on\u00a0corpses.But, citing an Argentine historian, the Guardian\u00a0disputes the connection between beliefs about this folk horror and the presidential act of adopting a seventh son as a godson, and says the latter is a distinct\u00a0custom brought over by Eastern European migrants. In updates posted to their Web\u00a0sites, both the Independent and Buzzfeed say European folklore surrounding\u00a0seventh sons included\u00a0fears of the child turning into a monster.In any case, Americans should not be so quick to scoff at the tradition and its embrace by Argentina's head of state, in whatever form. After all, the U.S. president participates in the\u00a0ritual pardoning of a fluffy and presumably bewildered animal every year.Update: This post has been updated to reflect new skepticism around initial media reports.The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy\u00a0Policy"}
