We've received your submission.\tWhen scientist Piotr Naskrecki heard rustling in a rainforest, he expected to see a possum or rat.But his curiosity turned to shock when a puppy-sized spider bristled under his flashlight.\u201cWhen I turned on the light, I couldn\u2019t quite understand what I was seeing,\u201d Naskrecki, an entomologist and photographer at Harvard University\u2019s Museum of Comparative Zoology, told Live Science.Goliath Encounter: Puppy-Sized Spider Surprises Scientist in Rainforest @BearGrylls @midnight http://t.co/53uokAMOlu pic.twitter.com/OVNyAJk2YL\u2014 Live Science (@LiveScience) October 20, 2014The South American Goliath birdeater is the world\u2019s largest spider, with a leg span of up to a foot (or the size of \u201ca child\u2019s forearm\u201d) and weighing more than 6 ounces.\u201cIts feet have hardened tips and claws that produce a very distinct, clicking sound, not unlike that of a horse\u2019s hoofs hitting the ground,\u201d Naskrecki wrote on his blog, The Smaller Majority.Naskrecki, who spotted the colossal creature in a South American rainforest in 2012, saw it rub its hind legs against its abdomen, sending out hairs with tiny barbs on them. He said the barbs are \u201cextremely painful and itchy.\u201dThe highly venomous arachnid also has 2-inch fangs.But the good news is, even if it bites you, \u201ca chicken can probably do more damage,\u201d Naskrecki said.Naskrecki caught the female and took her back to his lab to study. \n\t\t\t\t\tView video\t\t\t\t\nShare Selection"}
