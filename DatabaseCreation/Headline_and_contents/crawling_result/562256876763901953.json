{"id": "562256876763901953", "headline": "'Madden NFL 15' Predicts Super Bowl Patriots Victory - Right Down To The Score", "content": "A couple days ago, I posted about EA Sports'\u00a0Madden NFL 15\u00a0Super Bowl XLIX prediction.I had no idea the video game simulation would be so accurate.Not only did\u00a0Madden predict a New England Patriots victory over the Seattle Seahawks, the game predicted the final score of 28-24.That's very nearly as perfect a Super Bowl prediction as you're likely to find, and it spurs the game's big game track record to 9-3.Not bad, for a video game.The\u00a0Madden\u00a0prediction also saw the Patriots making a second half comeback for the win. It also predicted Tom Brady as MVP, with 335 yards and\u00a0four touchdowns.Brady's actual numbers? Just seven yards short of the prediction with 328 yards passing and four touchdowns. That's...crazy.The game also predicted Edelman's winning touchdown and was surprisingly close in a number of other key stats.What\u00a0the video game\u00a0didn't anticipate were the final moments of the Super Bowl, which ended not with a bang but with a whimper.There was no way the video game could predict the awesome, unexpected reception by\u00a0receiver Jermaine Kearse.And nobody could have seen that final interception. I mean, who makes a call like that? Not in a video game and certainly not in real life.Either way, talk about an incredible prediction from EA Sports and\u00a0Madden NFL 15. I'm not sure anyone else came this close.Check out the original prediction and video here.Erik Kain writes a widely read and respected blog about video games, entertainment and  culture at Forbes.
