Trump called for Muslims to be barred from entering the United States, The New York Times asked Muslims in New York for their reactions. Here are excerpts from those interviews, in which they shared their personal experiences as Muslims, New Yorkers and Americans.\nOn a possible Trump presidency: \u201cI told my wife if Trump gets elected, I\u2019ll leave this country.\u201cI have three daughters. When we first came to America [in 2002], I had a sister and we used to live in Nashville, Tenn. It was a small town. She wore a head scarf. She was the only one in middle school who wore a head scarf. At that point in time, some person makes a remark that, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a cousin of Osama bin Laden.\u2019 The teacher took the matter into her hands and calmed down the situation.\u201cNow, if someone does that similar thing to my daughters, and the teachers are not able to \u2013 if they are a Trump fan \u2013 and there is no one to rectify that wrong behavior, that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of. \u201cHow can you normalize the situation? If the president is like that, he has the support.\u201d Liz RobbinsOn growing up Muslim: \u201cRight before fourth grade, I remember when I was playing on the playground and some tall kids came and pushed me. I used to wear my hijab back then. There was some hurtful things thrown at me. When I came home and cried, I remember my parents telling me, I should not be ashamed of who I am, and nobody is going to push me around. \u201cPeople sometimes, when you\u2019re standing on the street, on the ferry or in the train, people keep staring at you. Especially after what happened in Paris, after what Donald Trump said, about us wearing a badge and trying to prove us being Muslims and having actually identification as a Muslim. \u201cThat was something that kind of felt disrespectful. I don\u2019t see anyone else doing that. I feel like it\u2019s something once that Hitler said to the Jews that they should start wearing a badge as identification. Why do I have to tell who I am? I was born and raised in America. I feel like that\u2019s the only identification I should have on me.\u201d Liz RobbinsOn being Muslim in New York: \u201cWhen I\u2019m on the train, people don\u2019t want to sit beside me. I\u2019d like to talk but it\u2019s easier to be silent. It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s easier for those who look American, but people who dress like me with a beard and kufi and my wife, who is covered, guys on the train see you and give you a grilled look.\u201cDo you know me? Do you know my heart? Why are you judging by looking at me?\u201dEmily PalmerOn his reaction to the San Bernardino attack: \u201cThe first reaction, obviously, was shock. As officers, we had the radios tuned in because we wanted to find out what was happening, right after the shooting. We tweeted about the S.U.V. and a safety hot line. \u201cWhen we found out that the shooters were Muslim \u2013 because we didn\u2019t know that at first \u2013 it was very disturbing. It\u2019s hard because we work so hard against that stereotype and when people hear that they were Muslim, it takes you back. We have to work harder to say that\u2019s not us. \u201cRight after the 9/11 attacks, I was in the military, and each soldier was assigned to a police officer to help protect the World Trade Center. This was the day after the attacks. \u201cWe were talking, and he said, \u201cKilling is in their religion,\u2019 and I let him talk. Then I said, \u201cWhat do you think I am?\u201d I said, \u2018I\u2019m Muslim,\u2019 and his jaw dropped and his eyes widened and he said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 I said, \u2018Don\u2019t be sorry. It\u2019s not your fault because whatever you hear, you believe.\u2019\u201d Emily PalmerOn teaching and wearing the hijab: \u201cWhen my students get up to say the Pledge of Allegiance, I\u2019m up there with them, pledging every single day. It\u2019s devastating to think people are questioning our loyalty to a country that we love. \u201cI work in a very diverse school, so many of my students interact with Muslim students all day. I\u2019ll be honest, they never have asked me, \u2018Why do you wear the hijab?\u2019 A lot of them are just like, \u2018Oh they practice the Muslim faith. They wear it because of modesty.\u2019\u201cI think I\u2019m the only hijabi teacher in New Utrecht High School, and you know, some of them have asked me questions about my faith, but nothing I deemed inappropriate or made me feel uncomfortable.\u201d Elizabeth A. HarrisOn being Muslim in Harlem: \u201cOne thing about being a Muslim in Harlem in the 70s, it was not that weird. Why? Because the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X \u2013 it was the Harlem base here a few blocks away. In terms of African-Americans being Muslim, it was not unusual. \u201cMuslims had a very positive image. People respected us. Our mosque, we used to have an annual street fair, pre-Ramadan and post-Ramadan. There are neighborhood kids, they\u2019re not Muslim, who have the memory that the mosque had the street fair, we had the vendors, we had the music, we had the face-painting and all the activities for the kids. \u201cTo me, now, it\u2019s the same in Harlem. Why? We have so much diversity in Harlem that we\u2019re accustomed to the diversity and Muslims are so ever-present that everybody knows a Muslim. And so, to hear somebody\u2019s rhetoric over the media, it\u2019s like, I know Muslims, hey, it\u2019s not a problem for me. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s with people of African descent, we\u2019re rather accustomed, certainly of my generation, to discrimination. So what else is new? Who is the new \u2018other\u2019 this week?\u201d Liz RobbinsOn being Muslim and a police chaplain: \u201cOne of the things that we do as police chaplains is we go down to the ground zero memorial every year on Sept. 11. We have breakfast with family members who lost loved ones on that day. Before the current structure that\u2019s there, and while it was being built, the ceremony was a little more closed off. On the ninth anniversary of the attack, Vice President Biden was there. We were in a place where they had the stage where the ceremony was taking place, in front of that was an area for family members and city officials.\u201cI\u2019m wearing my police uniform, which is an inspector\u2019s uniform, and I\u2019m standing and I\u2019m talking to family members prior to the ceremony starting, and three men approach me who are wearing suits, saying, \u2018Secret Service has identified you from the top of a building and they want us to check your credentials just in case.\u2019 I said, \u2018Just in case what?\u2019 And they said, \u2018We\u2019re sorry that we\u2019re doing this to you,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Then why are you doing it?\u2019 What\u2019s being questioned there is not really my physical presence, but I think a lot of the validity of my emotion tied to that space.\u201d J. David GoodmanOn dealing with the public: \u201cI\u2019m a station agent. I\u2019m a frontline employee and I deal with customers every day. From time to time you face customers that are a little rude. You can\u2019t always accommodate every need like a MetroCard malfunction. For some, when you can\u2019t help them, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear \u2018Muslim, go back to your country.\u2019 We get that all the time. It\u2019s a normal thing now these days to hear. \u2018You don\u2019t belong here. Why don\u2019t you go back?\u2019\u201dJeffrey E. SingerAdvertisement"}
