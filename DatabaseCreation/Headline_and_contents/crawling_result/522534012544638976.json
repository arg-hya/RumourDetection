Mind you, Variety technically says that Bale is merely \"in talks,\" but the rest of the article seems pretty certain that it's a done deal. In case you've forgotten, Sony's film is the one penned by Aaron Sorkinwho also wrote the scripts for The Social Network and Moneyball)  is directed by Danny Boyle (remember Slumdog Millionaire?) and is actually based on Walter Issacson's official biography of Steve Jobs. In other words, it's shaping up to be a class act. Maybe it'll be enough to wash away memories of that other Jobs film. [Variety]Didn't we have a Steve Jobs movie already?"}
