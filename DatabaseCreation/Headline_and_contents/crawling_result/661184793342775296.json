They must set aside their first hours of the day to invest in their top-priority activities before other people\u2019s priorities come rushing in.Science supports this strategy. Vanderkam cites the famous finding of\u00a0Roy Baumeister, a\u00a0Florida State University psychology professor, that willpower is like a muscle that becomes fatigued from overuse.Diets, he says, come undone in the evening, just as poor self-control and lapses in decision-making often come later in the day. On the other hand, early mornings offer a fresh supply of willpower, and people tend to be more optimistic and ready to tackle challenging tasks.So what do successful executives and entrepreneurs do when they are rested and fresh? From\u00a0Vanderkam\u2019s study of morning rituals\u00a0and our own research, we outline the following 14 things that the most successful people do before breakfast. While they might not do all of these things every morning, each has been found to be an effective way to start the day.They wake up early.Successful people know that time is a precious commodity. And while theirs is easily eaten up by phone calls, meetings, and sudden crises once they\u2019ve gotten to the office, the morning hours are under their control. That\u2019s why many of them rise before the sun, squeezing out as much time as they can to do with as they please.In a poll of 20 executives cited by Vanderkam, 90% said they wake up before 6 a.m. on weekdays. PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, for example, wakes at 4 a.m. and is in the office no later than 7 a.m. Meanwhile, Disney CEO Bob Iger gets up at 4:30 to read, and Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey is up at 5:30 to jog.The bottom line: Productive mornings start with early wake-up calls.They drink water.Many successful executives reach for water instead of coffee first thing in the morning.Kat Cole,\u00a0president of Focus Brands, parent company of\u00a0Auntie Anne\u2019s, Carvel, and Cinnabon,\u00a0wakes up a 5 a.m. every morning and drinks 24 ounces of water.Huffington Post founder\u00a0Arianna Huffington\u00a0and Birchbox Man chief Brad Lande\u00a0start their days with a glass of hot water with lemon.Drinking water in the morning helps you feel more alert, rehydrates your body, and kickstarts your metabolism, says\u00a0Rania Batayneh, MPH, a nutritionist and author of \u201cThe One One One Diet.\u201dThey exercise before it falls off the to-do list.The top morning activity of the rich and powerful seems to be exercise, be it lifting weights at home or going to the gym.For example,\u00a0Vanderkam notes that Xerox CEO Ursula Burns schedules an hour-long personal training session at 6 a.m. twice a week. Plus, \u201cShark Tank\u201d investor Kevin O\u2019Leary gets up at 5:45 every morning and jumps on\u00a0the elliptical or exercise bike, andentrepreneur\u00a0Gary Vaynerchuk starts every day\u00a0with an hour-long workout\u00a0with his trainer.\u201cThese are incredibly busy people,\u201d says Vanderkam. \u201cIf they make time to exercise, it must be important.\u201dBeyond the fact that exercising in the morning means they can\u2019t later run out of time, Vanderkam says a pre-breakfast workout helps reduce stress later in the day, counteracts the effects of high-fat diet, and improves sleep.They work on a top-priority business project.The quiet hours of the morning can be the ideal time to focus on an important work project without being interrupted. What\u2019s more, spending time on it at the beginning of the day ensures that it gets your attention before others \u2014 kids, employees, bosses \u2014 use it up.Vanderkam uses the example of a business strategist who dealt with so many ad hoc meetings and interruptions throughout the day that she felt she couldn\u2019t get anything done. She started thinking of the early mornings as project time, and chose a top-priority project each day to focus on. Sure enough, not a single colleague dropped in on her at 6:30 a.m. She could finally concentrate.They work on a personal-passion project.Novel-writing and art-making are\u00a0easy to skip when you\u2019ve been in meetings all day, are tired and hungry, and have to figure out what\u2019s for dinner. That\u2019s why many successful people put in an hour or so on their personal projects before they officially start their days.A history teacher at the\u00a0University of Chicago\u00a0told Vanderkam that she spent\u00a0the hours between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. working on a book about the religious politics of West Africa. She was able to\u00a0read journal articles and write several pages before dealing with her teaching responsibilities.Carving out the time in the morning to write, and making it a habit, meant she would actually follow through. Vanderkam cites one study of young professors that showed that writing a little bit every day rather than in intense bursts made them more likely to get tenure.They spend quality time with family.We may exalt the family dinner, but there\u2019s nothing that says you have to have a big family meal at night, says Vanderkam. Some successful people use the mornings to invest in family time, whether reading stories to the kids or cooking a big breakfast together.A\u00a0financial planner in New York told Vanderkam that, unless she\u2019s traveling, mornings are her special time with her young daughter. She helps her get dressed, make the bed, and occasionally they work on art projects together. They also make breakfast and sit around the table and chat about what\u2019s going on. She calls those 45 minutes \u201cthe most precious time I have in a day.\u201dThey connect with their spouses.In the evening, it\u2019s more likely you\u2019ll be tired from the day\u2019s activities, and time can easily be wasted with dinner preparations and zoning out in front of the TV. That\u2019s why many successful people make connecting with their partners a morning ritual.Besides, as Vanderkam wonders, what could be better than pre-dawn sex to energize you for the day? After all, regular sex may make you smarter, boost your income, and burn calories.Even if they\u2019re not getting frisky every morning, many couples use the early hours to talk. For instance, she notes that a BlackRock executive\u00a0and his wife commute from the suburbs into New York City every morning. They spend the hour-plus trip discussing their lives, finances, household to-do lists, and plans for the week.They make their beds.This one-minute habit can make you happier and more productive all day long.In his book, \u201cThe Power of Habit,\u201d Charles Duhigg writes that getting into the routine of making your bed every morning is correlated with increased productivity.Making your bed doesn\u2019t necessarily causeyou to get more done at work, Duhigg writes, but it\u2019s a \u201ckeystone habit\u201d that can spark \u201cchain reactions that help other good habits take hold.\u201dIn addition to\u00a0being more productive, people that consistently make their beds also tend to have\u00a0\u201ca greater sense of well-being and stronger skills at sticking with a budget,\u201d Duhigg writes.They network over coffee.Especially if you like to make it home for dinner, the mornings can be a great time to meet with people for coffee or breakfast. Plus, networking breakfasts are less disruptive than midday lunches and more work-oriented than boozy cocktail parties, Vanderkam notes.Christopher Colvin, a New York-based lawyer and entrepreneur, started a networking group for Ivy League alums called IvyLife. Most days he wakes at 5:30 a.m. to walk his dog and read, but every Wednesday he attends an IvyLife networking breakfast. \u201cI feel I\u2019m fresher and more creative in the mornings,\u201d he told Vanderkam. \u201cBy the end of the day my mind is more cluttered.\u201dThey meditate to clear their minds.Type-A personalities typically demand as much from others as they do from themselves, so it can be difficult for them to disconnect from their mental to-do lists and calm their minds. Before they head out the door, many successful people devote themselves to a spiritual practice such as meditation or prayer to center themselves for the rush of the day.Manisha Thakor, a financial adviser and former corporate executive, practices transcendental meditation to clear her mind. She does two 20-minute sessions a day, the first before breakfast and the second in the evening, and focuses on breathing and repeating a mantra in her head. She\u2019s found it to be \u201cone of the most life-enhancing practices\u201d she\u2019s ever experienced, she told Vanderkam.They write down things they\u2019re grateful for.Expressing gratitude is another great way to center yourself and get the proper perspective before heading to the office. Writing down the people, places, and opportunities that you\u2019re grateful for takes just a few minutes but can make a real difference in your outlook.For example, a\u00a0pharmaceutical executive told Vanderkam she spends a good chunk of her morning \u201cexpressing gratitude, asking for guidance, and being open to inspiration.\u201d When she gets to work, she always has a clear vision for herself and her staff.Similarly, entrepreneur and author of \u201cThe 4-Hour Workweek,\u201d Tim Ferriss,\u00a0spends five minutes each morning writing down what he\u2019s grateful for and what he\u2019s looking forward to. It \u201callows me to not only get more done during the day but to also feel better throughout the entire day, to be a happier person, to be a more content person,\u201d he said.They plan and strategize while they\u2019re fresh.Planning the day, week, or month ahead is an important time-management tool to keep you on track when you\u2019re in the thick of it. Using the mornings to do big-picture thinking helps you prioritize and set the trajectory of the day.One banking exec turned teacher told Vanderkam she wakes at 5 a.m. on weekdays, exercises, reads a few Bible verses, and reviews her tasks for the day before making breakfast. She said this ritual makes her days more manageable and effective.They check their email.While time-management gurus may suggest putting off email as long as possible, many successful people start the day with email. In fact, one recent survey found that\u00a0the first thing most executives do in the morning is\u00a0check their email.They may quickly scan their inboxes for urgent messages that need an immediate response or craft a few important emails that they can better focus on while their minds are fresh.For instance, Gretchen Rubin, author of \u201cThe Happiness Project,\u201d wakes at 6 every morning before her family\u2019s up at 7. She uses the time to clear her inbox, schedule the day, and read social media. Getting these tasks out of the way from the start helps her concentrate better when she moves on to more challenging projects, she told Vanderkam.They read the news.Whether it\u2019s sitting in the corner diner and reading the papers or checking the blogs and Twitter from their phones, most successful people have a pre-breakfast ritual for getting the latest headlines.For example, GE CEO Jeff Immelt starts his days with a cardio workout and then reads the paper and watches CNBC. Meanwhile, Virgin America CEO David Cush uses his mornings to listen to sports radio and read the papers while hitting the stationary bike at the gym.By the time they get to work, they have a good idea of what\u2019s going on in the world.
