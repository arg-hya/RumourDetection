Boys and girls.\u201cIt\u2019s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.\u201cA lot of boys like dolls houses. They\u2019re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They\u2019re more exciting than dolls houses.\u201cThe most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.\u201dWhile the image appears to include a copyright from 1974 and the name of a printer in Hamburg used by Lego at the time, the authenticity of the letter could not be independently verified, and a spokesperson for Lego was not immediately available for comment.User fryd_ commented that \u201cit seems like we\u2019ve taken a step backwards\u201d since the letter was written. But others disagreed \u2013 with Taliesen13 responding: \u201cThat sounds like the moral of The Lego Movie.\u201dJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
