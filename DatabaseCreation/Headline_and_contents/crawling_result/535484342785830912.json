A schoolboy in Russia claims an electric shock left him with super powers to attract metal, like the X-Men character.Nikolai Kryaglyachenko says he leant against a faulty lamp post and he was hit by a blast of electricity.Since then he's been able to stick metal objects all over his body, he told Russian GTRK TV.\"When I got out of bed the next day I found some coins that had been on the mattress stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.\"He says he's a fan of the Marvel comics and Magneto - who can generate magnetic force fields.But Nikolai says it's not just forks, spoons and coins that stick to him, he's found sometimes his powers extend to other things too.He said: \"I get this skill even when I don't want it. For instance, a glass didn't stick to me, but moved by itself to me once. \"And he says he's become really popular at school. The GTRK report shows his friends trying to stick metal objects all over his body.But how likely is it that he could be a real-life Magneto? Doctor Ipsita Roy is a specialist in microbial biotechnology at the University of Westminster and says it's not. She told Newsbeat: \"There's no way he could become magnetic after an electric shock. Electricity can't magnetise the body.\"So, it goes without saying, don't try this at home. But also Dr. Roy says there must be another reason his skin is attracting objects.\"Either he's eaten something which makes him magnetic, which would naturally pass out of the body quickly anyway,\" she says.\"Or he could have something attached to his body which isn't visible. Or it could be glue.\"But Nikolai wants to become a real Magneto when he's older, especially if it means he can use his powers to help people.\"I'm thinking of becoming a superhero now,\" he added.Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTubeAfghan leader addresses nation as Taliban advanceThe comments come as the Taliban close in on the capital Kabul, with fierce fighting under way.July was Earth's hottest month ever recorded\u00e2\u0080\u0098World silently watches this war against women\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Video\u00e2\u0080\u0098World silently watches this war against women\u00e2\u0080\u0099'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car'Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedomsWill Biden's biggest call yet also be his most calamitous?The female Afghan journalist who won't give up.
