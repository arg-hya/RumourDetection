A formal search has been launched for them.Mr Aguirre has promised new developments in the investigation over the next few days.\"I have big hopes of finding our young students alive. That is why we have now entered a new phase in the search for them,\" he said.The clandestine graves were located in the outskirts of Iguala following an anonymous tip off.Twenty-eight burnt bodies were retrieved from the pits. Forensic experts are still working to identify all of them, said Mr Aguirre. The students all attended a local teacher training college with a history of left-wing activism.Six students were killed in two separate shooting incidents during the protests in Iguala, which lies some 200km (120 miles) south of the capital, Mexico City.But it is not clear whether they were targeted for their political beliefs.Some think that they may have angered a local drug gang called Guerreros Unidos by refusing to pay extortion money.Thousands of people have taken to the streets across Mexico to demand government action to locate the students.President Enrique Pena Nieto went on national television to promise to identify and punish those responsible for the disappearance.He described the incident as \"shocking, painful and unacceptable\" and said there will be \"no impunity\".New mass graves found in Mexico townProtests over Mexico disappearances'No impunity' over Mexico studentsAfghan leader addresses nation as Taliban advanceThe comments come as the Taliban close in on the capital Kabul, with fierce fighting under way.July was Earth's hottest month ever recorded\u00e2\u0080\u0098World silently watches this war against women\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Video\u00e2\u0080\u0098World silently watches this war against women\u00e2\u0080\u0099'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car'Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedomsWill Biden's biggest call yet also be his most calamitous?The female Afghan journalist who won't give up.
