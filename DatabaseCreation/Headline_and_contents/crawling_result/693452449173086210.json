At the same time, those individuals who will one day pay their female classmates a fraction of the industry standard have fallen further behind.\u201d Malone added that if current trends in education continue, women will soon outnumber nearly all future tech workers, financial analysts, and government leaders at the nation\u2019s universities by a two-to-one margin."}
