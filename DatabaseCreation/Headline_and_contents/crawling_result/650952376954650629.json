I intend to argue that the bag which contains the bag which contains the raw meat also contains the raw meat.\u201cAnd therefore it must also be free.\u201dVeteran check-out assistant Margaret Gerving said: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a monumental quantity of high-grade twattishness. I\u2019ve decided to adopt a policy of quiet pity rather than anger.\u201dBishop added: \u201cI\u2019m confident the whole thing should take no more than an hour and 45 minutes.\u201dEVERY company now has a \u2018punk ethos\u2019 that drives it forward.Firms, including fashion chains, software developers and multinational petrochemical corporations, have all confirmed they are challenging establishment values in a dangerous, edgy way.Business analyst Julian Cook said: \u201cYour customers want to know that you\u2019re not playing by the same old bullshit rules. Why would anyone buy a product that was not the result of creative anarchy?\u201dClothing retailer Martin Bishop, said: \u201cBeing punk is what we\u2019re all about. That\u2019s why we buy the products in China for a couple of pence and then sell them in Britain for a couple of quid.\u201cIt\u2019s all totally punk as fuck.\u201dBanking executive Roy Hobbs added: \u201cWe loan people money for things they can\u2019t afford and then threaten them with the bailiffs when they don\u2019t pay it back.\u201cSo my biggest influence would have to be Joe Strummer.\u201d"}
