Pope Francis Leaves Pearly Gates Open", "content": "AdvertisementSupported byBy Rick GladstonePope Francis has given hope to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory. Now, he has endeared himself to dog lovers, animal rights activists and vegans.During a weekly general audience at the Vatican last month, the pope, speaking of the afterlife, appeared to suggest that animals could go to heaven, asserting, \u201cHoly Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us.\u201dItaly\u2019s Corriere della Sera newspaper, analyzing the pope\u2019s remarks, concluded he believed animals have a place in the afterlife. It drew an analogy to comforting words that Pope Paul VI was said to have once told a distraught boy whose dog had died: \u201cOne day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God\u2019s creatures.\u201dThe news accounts of Francis\u2019 remarks were welcomed by groups like the Humane Society of the United States and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, who saw them as a repudiation of conservative Roman Catholic theology that says animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls.\u201cMy inbox got flooded,\u201d said Christine Gutleben, senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the United States. \u201cAlmost immediately, everybody was talking about it.\u201dCharles Camosy, an author and professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University, said it was difficult to know precisely what Francis meant, since he spoke \u201cin pastoral language that is not really meant to be dissected by academics.\u201d But asked whether the remarks had caused a new debate on whether animals have souls, suffer and go to heaven, Mr. Camosy said, \u201cIn a word: absolutely.\u201dIn his relatively short tenure as leader of the world\u2019s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI, Francis, 77, has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church. He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues like homosexuality, single motherhood and unwed couples. So to some extent, it was not a surprise that Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals, would suggest that they have a place in heaven.In his remarks, as reported by Vatican Radio, Francis said of paradise: \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to think of this, to think we will find ourselves up there. All of us in heaven. It\u2019s good, it gives strength to our soul.\u201cAt the same time, the Holy Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us, and that came out of the thought and the heart of God.\u201dTheologians cautioned that Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of America, the Catholic magazine, said he believed that Francis was at least asserting that \u201cGod loves and Christ redeems all of creation,\u201d even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals.The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church\u2019s history. Pope Pius IX, who led the church from 1846 to 1878, longer than any other pope, strongly supported the doctrine that dogs and other animals have no consciousness. He even sought to thwart the founding of an Italian chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.Pope John Paul II appeared to reverse Pius in 1990 when he proclaimed that animals do have souls and are \u201cas near to God as men are.\u201d But the Vatican did not widely publicize his assertion, perhaps because it so directly contradicted Pius, who was the first to declare the doctrine of papal infallibility in 1854.John Paul\u2019s successor, Benedict, seemed to emphatically reject his view in a 2008 sermon in which he asserted that when an animal dies, it \u201cjust means the end of existence on earth.\u201dMs. Gutleben of the Humane Society said Francis\u2019 apparent reversal of Benedict\u2019s view could be enormous. \u201cIf the pope did mean that all animals go to heaven, then the implication is that animals have a soul,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s true, then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them. We have to admit that these are sentient beings, and they mean something to God.\u201dSarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA, one of the most activist anti-slaughterhouse groups, said the pope\u2019s remarks vindicated the biblical portrayal of heaven as peaceful and loving, and could influence eating habits, moving Catholics away from consuming meat \u2014 which she asserted had already been happening anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s a vegan world, life over death and peace between species,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not a Catholic historian, but PETA\u2019s motto is that animals aren\u2019t ours, and Christians agree. Animals aren\u2019t ours, they\u2019re God\u2019s.\u201dWhether the pope\u2019s remarks will prove to be a persuasive new reason not to eat meat, a potentially worrisome development to the multibillion-dollar beef, pork, poultry and seafood industries, remains unclear at best. But they did cause discussion.\u201cAs on quite a few other things Pope Francis has said, his recent comments on all animals going to heaven have been misinterpreted,\u201d Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said in an email. \u201cThey certainly do not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin.\u201d Mr. Warner quoted passages from Genesis that say man is given \u201cdominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on earth.\u201d\u201cWhile that \u2018dominion\u2019 means use for human benefit, it also requires stewardship \u2014 humane care and feeding \u2014 something all farmers who raise animals practice every day of every year,\u201d Mr. Warner said.Father Martin said he did not believe the pope\u2019s remarks could be construed as a comment on vegetarianism. But, he said, \u201che\u2019s reminding us that all creation is holy and that in his mind, paradise is open to all creatures, and frankly, I agree with him.\u201dLaura Hobgood-Oster, professor of religion and environmental studies at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Tex., and an expert on the history of dog-human interaction, said she believed that there would be a backlash from religious conservatives, but that it would take time.\u201cThe Catholic Church has never been clear on this question; it\u2019s all over the place, because it begs so many other questions,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere do mosquitoes go, for God\u2019s sake?\u201dAdvertisement"}
