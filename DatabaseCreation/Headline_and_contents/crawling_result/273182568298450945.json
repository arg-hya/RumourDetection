At the moment, hundreds of thousands of American shoppers are still unaccounted for, and we expect $2 billion in damage has been wrought upon our cities. \u201d\u201cThe stench of death is unbearable,\u201d a tearful Grass added. \u201cSimply unbearable.\u201dAs the weekend of sales drew to a close, ambulances could be seen circling the now empty and completely ravaged shopping complexes as they searched for signs of life, while clean-up crews worked to clear the rubble, overturned cars, and large pools of blood from local Kohl\u2019s and Macy\u2019s parking lots.The White House issued an official response, stating, \u201cWe mourn the deaths of those 42 million American shoppers who tragically lost their lives this Black Friday.\u201dSurvivors of the deadly holiday sales event said that while the weekend began as a chance to \u201cget in on some unbeatable post-Thanksgiving deals,\u201d it quickly escalated into a merciless, no-hold-barred fight to the death.\u201cAt some point in time we all stopped caring about the deals and the holiday shopping and were pretty much just out for blood,\u201d said Dana Marshall, 37, a Target shopper who suffered seven broken ribs and a cracked sternum while fighting two other customers for a discounted Nikon digital camera. \u201cI remember just sitting on top of a woman and smacking her head with a DVD player until her face was completely unrecognizable. I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing.\u201dThe Onion will continue to publish a running list of the Black Friday dead throughout the week."}
