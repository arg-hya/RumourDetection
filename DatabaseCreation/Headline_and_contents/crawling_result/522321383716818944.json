The agency said the positive result was returned from a preliminary test, and that \"confirmation testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's laboratory is being done.\"The worker was in isolation at a Dallas hospital within 90 minutes of her finding she had an elevated temperature, officials said. They also said she lives alone with no pets.After revealing her diagnosis, the CDC also announced the health care worker had taken a flight from Cleveland to Dallas the day before presenting symptoms. Officials are trying to track down all 132 passengers aboard.In response to the latest Ebola case, the White House announced Tuesday that Obama is calling off a planned trip to New Jersey and Connecticut and instead will convene Cabinet officials coordinating the government's Ebola response.Crews were at the health care worker's apartment early Wednesday morning, located in north Dallas, reports CBS Dallas. They began decontaminating the complex's common areas and the space outside of the patient's home, as well as distributing flyers to residents. The patient's vehicle and apartment unit will be decontaminated starting early Wednesday afternoon.Flyer distributed to residents in cmplx of 2nd hlth care wrkr w/Ebola. @dallaspiosana @DallasFireRes_q #DallasEbola pic.twitter.com/dC1RY6MoLE@DallasFireRes_q Haz-Mat taping off door. pic.twitter.com/1uJQCzV9SgDallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said at a news conference Wednesday that the health care provider at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital had been monitoring herself for symptoms of Ebola. The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed in a separate statement that the health worker did provide care to Thomas Eric Duncan, whom officials refer to as \"the index patient\" and is the Liberian national who died at Presbyterian on Oct. 8. Duncan was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on U.S. soil, although he is believed to have contracted the disease while still in Liberia.It was not immediately clear what contact the new case had with Duncan.Officials have said they also don't know how the first health worker, a nurse, became infected. But the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said \"an additional health care worker testing positive for Ebola is a serious concern.\"\t\"What happened there (in Dallas), regardless of the reason, is not acceptable. It shouldn't have happened,\" Anthony Fauci, director of the Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of NIH, said on MSNBC Wednesday.The state health agency said the new patient had been interviewed, \"to quickly identify any contacts or potential exposures, and those people will be monitored. The type of monitoring depends on the nature of their interactions and the potential they were exposed to the virus.\"\"We want to remind Dallas County residents not to panic and overreact,\" said county health director Zach Thompson. \"We just want Dallas County residents to stay calm.\"Nurse Nina Pham, the first person to contract Ebola on U.S. soil, also got the disease while caring for Duncan. She repeatedly visited his room from  the day he was admitted to the intensive care unit until the day before  he died, medical records show. Pham and other health  care workers wore protective gear, including gowns, gloves, masks and  face shields -- and sometimes full-body suits -- when caring for Duncan, but confirmation of the new case came a day after a national nurses union decried an absence of protocols at the Texas hospital.When Pham's mother learned she was caring for Duncan, she tried to reassure her that she would be safe.\tPham told her: \"Mom, no. Don't worry about me,\" family friend Christina Tran told The Associated Press.\tDuncan's medical records make numerous mentions of protective gear worn by hospital staff, and Pham herself notes wearing the gear in visits to Duncan's room. But there is no indication in the records of her first encounter with Duncan, on Sept. 29, that Pham donned any protective gear.Leaders of the National Nurses Union  read a statement Tuesday which they said represented concerns from a  number of nurses that work at Texas Health Presbyterian in Dallas. The  union officials declined to identify the Dallas nurses or say how many  were participating in the statement.But they were vociferous in  citing a lack of protocols on the day Duncan was  admitted with extreme symptoms of Ebola.Among the flaws cited by the group included: \"Were protocols breached?\" said union spokeswoman Rose Ann DeMoro, \"There were no protocols.\"\"These  nurses are not well protected. They're not prepared to handle Ebola or  any other pandemic,\" said DeMoro. \"We are deeply alarmed.\"DeMoro  said the nurses who had come forward were afraid to reveal their  identities \"because of a culture of threat in the hospitals.\"Tuesday night, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital issued a statement in response to the nurses' charges, saying, \"patient  and employee safety is our greatest priority and we take compliance  very seriously.\"The hospital insisted that \"numerous measures\" were in place \"to provide a safe  working environment, including mandatory annual training and a 24-7  hotline and other mechanisms that allow for anonymous reporting.\"  But also on Tuesday, the nation's top  disease-fighting agency acknowledged that federal health experts  failed to do all they should have done to prevent Ebola from spreading in Dallas when and after Duncan was admitted.CDC Director Tom Frieden outlined a series of steps designed to  stop the spread of the disease in the U.S., including increased training  for health care workers and changes at Texas Health Presbyterian to minimize the risk of more infections. He also said the CDC was forming rapid response teams to intervene wherever an Ebola diagnosis presents itself in the U.S. \"within hours.\"A total of 76 people at the hospital  might have had exposure to Duncan, and all of them were  being monitored for fever and other symptoms daily, Frieden said. It wasn't immediately confirmed that the new case was one of the 76 people being monitored.Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell told \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday there haven't been any alterations of the virus that would raise concern about protocols.With 30 years of treatment and containment ofthe Ebola virus behind them, Burwell said they knew to implement additional oversight to ensure those protocols were implemented this time. \"There will be 24/7 site managers who will oversee the taking on and taking off of equipment, as well as the fact that we've added additional CDC staff on site,\" she said on \"CBS This Morning.\"Another possibility for spreading the disease was the \"the interventions that were done to try desperately to keep the index patient alive, (including) dialysis and intubation. These are two procedures which can result in the spread of infectious material,\" CDC head Frieden said.Starting Sunday, the CDC began re-evaluating the protocols for using protective gear and limiting the number of Ebola patients a facility can treat, reports CBS News correspondent Vicente Arenas. \nFirst published on October 15, 2014 / 5:18 AM\n\n\u00a9 2014 CBS Interactive Inc.
