Iraqi officials said Sunday that an airstrike wounded the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such a strike or al-Baghdadi being wounded. Iraq's Defense and Interior Ministries issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without elaborating. A senior Iraqi official has said a key aide to al-Baghdadi, named Abdur Rahman al-Athaee, or Abu Sajar, was killed in the strike, the Guardian reported. An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was hit during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim in Iraq's western Anbar province. The official, citing informants within the militant group, said the strike wounded al-Baghdadi. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded. Both officials said the operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces. Neither knew the extent of al-Baghdadi's apparent injuries. Both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential material. State television later also reported that al-Baghdadi had been wounded. Al-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community. Earlier on Sunday, a Tweeter account attributed to Islamic State spokesman Mohammed al-Adnani also implied that al-Baghdadi was wounded. \"Do you think the Caliphate would end with the Caliph's death? We announce leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is in well, and wish him a speedy recovery.\" \u0648\u0647\u0644 \u062a\u0638\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u062a\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0633\u0634\u0647\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629\u061f \u0646\u0637\u0645\u0626\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0629 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0628\u0643\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u063a\u062f\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0628\u062e\u064a\u0631 \u0648\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u062f\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062c\u0644 #\u062f\u0639\u0627\u0621 But others in the Tweetersphere questioned the report, casting doubt on the account's authenticity.\u00a0 \"ISIL sources tell me this a fake account run by Jordanian intelligence and the news on Baghdadi injury is a hoax....,\" Al Jazeera reporter Imran Khan tweeted. Foreign Policy editor David Kenner also put in his two cents, citing researcher Romain Caillet as saying the account is fake, and the report on al-Baghdadi's injury was a hoax.\u00a0 FYI, researchers like @RomainCaillet say acct claiming to be ISIS spox is fake. Said Baghdadi injured in airstrike. https://t.co/7Od2OrDCId The reclusive leader is purported to have made only one public appearance, delivering a sermon at a mosque in Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. Al-Baghdadi's purported appearance in Mosul came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him. Since then, part of the Islamic State group's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as a ruler and not just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group now administers courts, fixes roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology. A U.S.-led coalition has been launching airstrikes on Islamic State militants and facilities in Iraq and Syria for months as part of an effort to give Iraqi forces the time and space to mount a more effective offensive. The Islamic State had gained ground across northern and western Iraq in a lightning advance in June and July, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray. On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, including into Anbar province, where fighting with Islamic State militants has been fierce. The plan could boost the total number of American troops in Iraq to 3,100. There now are about 1,400 U.S. troops in Iraq, out of the 1,600 previously authorized."}
