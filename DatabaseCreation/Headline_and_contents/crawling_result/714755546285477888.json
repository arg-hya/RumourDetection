He graduated\u2026Sponsored Links\n\n\nOne of Donald Trump\u2019s top campaign strategists, former communications director\u00a0Stephanie Cegielski, has resigned from his\u00a0campaign in protest of Trump\u2019s ridiculous statement that \u201conly he can solve\u201d the bombing in Pakistan (whatever that might mean). She has\u00a0penned a devastating open letter to his supporters, explaining to us why she originally supported Trump, and how his excess and dishonesty turned her against him. She issues a stark warning to Trump supporters\u00a0that the supposed \u201cauthenticity\u201d of Trump is nothing but smoke and mirrors, a soap opera character\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 and that at the end of the day, Donald Trump only cares about himself. A brutal denunciation of Trump as both a candidate and a person, it might be the most complete evisceration of the orange-haired rabble-rouser yet written.It will be interesting to see if Donald Trump\u2019s supporters will be able to dismiss this evisceration\u00a0so easily. They can\u2019t cry \u201cliberal media\u201d or establishment bias \u2013 this comes from inside his own camp, the people who know him better than any of his supporters. It\u2019s also a significant indication that Trump\u2019s own advisers are becoming increasingly tired of his racist antics and his utter refusal to formulate any kind of substantial policy proposals. They recognize that he is utterly unprepared for the presidency and has no desire to change that.An Open Letter to Trump Voters from His Top Strategist-Turned-DefectorEven Trump\u2019s most trusted advisors didn\u2019t expect him to fare this well.\u00a0Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it.\u00a0The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%.\u00a0His candidacy was a protest candidacy.It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on\u00a0American Idol.\u00a0President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority.\u00a0And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster \u2014 and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.Sponsored Links\n\n\n\nMy support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn\u2019t look promising.Sponsored Links\n\n\nIn 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.Sponsored Links\n\n\n\nI was sold.\u00a0Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC.\u00a0It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn\u2019t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.That was inspiring to me.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the \u201csilent majority\u201d of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite.\u00a0So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.I don\u2019t think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don\u2019t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver\u2019s seat, and nothing else matters.\u00a0The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy.\u00a0A devastating terrorist attack in Pakistan targeting Christians occurred on Easter Sunday, and Trump\u2019s response was to tweet, \u201cAnother radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead, 400 injured. I alone can solve.\u201dIgnoring the fact that at the time Trump tweeted this (time-stamped 4:37 p.m.) the latest news reports had already placed the number differently at 70 dead, 300 injured, take a moment to appreciate the ridiculous, cartoonish, almost childish arrogance of saying that he alone can solve. Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever.\u00a0Superhero powers where \u201cI alone can solve\u201d problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.What was once Trump\u2019s desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.I\u2019ll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now.\u00a0You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.He doesn\u2019t want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he\u00a0could have\u00a0run the White House. He\u2019s achieved that already and then some.\u00a0If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump.\u00a0And if you are one of the disaffected voters \u2014 one of the silent majority like me\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump\u2019s voice.\u00a0Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many \u201cpieces of ass.\u201d He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign\u2019s internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency onThe West Wing\u00a0where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet\u2019s staff was \u201cLet Bartlet Be Bartlet.\u201dInside the Trump camp, the slogan became \u201cLet Trump Be Trump.\u201dIt is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogan is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought \u201cCommon Core\u201d was a class at Equinox.The primary problem with this? What I\u2019ve seen the longer I\u2019ve helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong.\u00a0A more accurate internal slogan would read, \u201cLet Trump Help Trump.\u201dI don\u2019t dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it\u2019s important to let you know that the candidate does.I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know \u2014 the most frightening position of all.I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his \u201cbuild a wall\u201d stump speech and talked about his greatness.I felt sad for him at that moment.And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump\u2019s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you \u2014 I wanted Trump to be real, too.He is not.He even says so himself. His misogyny? That\u2019s the character.His presidential candidacy? That\u2019s a character, too.The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions \u2014 not political legacies.Trump made me believe. Until I woke up.\u00a0And he has no problem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and women out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.I came into this eager to support a savvy businessman who received little outside funding. I loved Trump\u2019s outsider status.\u00a0But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump.While the pundits pontificated about what type of PR stunt Trump had up his billion-dollar sleeves, I met with people who convinced me he was serious about changing the political conversation. I wanted to raise millions for him. I wanted to contribute to millions of votes.And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician.\u00a0I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.But something was shifting.Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing \u2014 aching, really \u2014 for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it.\u00a0What were once bold \u2014 although controversial \u2014 statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.And here\u2019s what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.Because we are all angry \u2014 and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.Unfortunately, the more vitriolic Trump has become, the more the people responded to him. That drove him to push the boundaries further and further.I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you \u2014 ever.Trump acts as if he\u2019s a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump isa work of fiction.No matter how many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the \u201cbest\u201d at being a president, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever other \u201cbest\u201d claim he has made in the last 15 minutes.He would be the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald Trump \u2014 at all costs.Don\u2019t let our country pay that price.This letter originally appeared on XOJane.comColin Taylor is the editor-in-chief of Occupy Democrats.
