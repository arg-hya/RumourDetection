The grand jury announced its decision in the case Monday.Wilson\u2019s resignation letter reads, in part:\u201cI have been told that my continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance that I cannot allow. For obvious reasons, I wanted to wait until the grand jury made their decision before I officially made my decision to resign. It was my hope to continue in police work, but the safety of other police officers and the community are of paramount importance to me. It is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal.\u201dWilson, who was paid an annual salary of $45,302, said he has not received a severance package, although he said he may negotiate with the department in hopes of receiving one. He said he\u2019s been told he is not the target of any ongoing internal police investigation.Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson declined to comment.The shooting of Brown, 18, who was unarmed, sparked worldwide protests that continue this weekend. Wilson had been on paid administrative leave since the shooting.Protesters, including Brown\u2019s family members, have accused Wilson of murder in Brown\u2019s death and called for a special prosecutor to pursue charges against Wilson.Anthony Gray, an attorney representing the Brown family, said he believes Wilson was acting merely for his own benefit.\u201cIt\u2019s probably in his best interest to sever his ties with the Ferguson community, as well as the Ferguson police department,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI think this incident has severely compromised his ability to police in the way he was paid to do by the city.\u201dPatricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for Ferguson township who has been active in the protests, said the resignation is too little, too late.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have the same impact that it would have months ago,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would have relieved a lot of anger and the pressure in the streets. It\u2019s been almost infuriating to get to this point and nothing has changed. There was no accountability and sense of responsibility for what has happened.\u201dBynes said other people involved in the investigation and its outcome \u2014 Jackson, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch and St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar \u2014 should have either resigned or been held accountable.\u201cEither everybody\u2019s an imbecile, or we have some negligence that\u2019s going on that\u2019s almost criminal,\u201d she said. \u201cSo Darren Wilson? He\u2019s the lowest man on the totem pole.\u201dProtester DeRay Mckesson said on Twitter that he and fellow protesters want an arrest, not a resignation, and that protests would continue. \u201cDarren Wilson is not in jail, as he should be,\u201d he said. \u201cHis resignation is important but not justice.\u201dThe U.S. Justice Department is conducting separate investigations into the killing and into the practices of the Ferguson Police Department. Those investigations are ongoing.On Tuesday, Wilson told ABC News that Brown was the aggressor in the minutes before the shooting. In an account that generally mirrored his testimony before the grand jury, Wilson said Brown had attacked him while the officer sat in his car, then fled. Wilson said he chased after Brown until Brown turned back toward him, refusing Wilson\u2019s commands to stop.As Brown approached, Wilson said, he warned Brown to stop. When he didn\u2019t stop, Wilson repeatedly fired his handgun.\u201cI had to. If I don\u2019t, he will kill me if he gets to me,\u201d Wilson said in the televised interview.Contrary to some reports, Wilson denied he had been paid for the ABC interview. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said Saturday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t jeopardize my integrity for a dollar.\u201dHe expressed gratitude for supporters, some of whom even offered him a home. \u201cIt\u2019s been unbelievable the amount of people who have reached out and don\u2019t even know me,\u201d he said.Wilson recently was married to another Ferguson police officer, Barbara Spradling, 36. The couple are expecting their first child. Wilson said the department has asked that Spradling, a 12-year veteran, also resign. He said she has so far declined to do so.He said he had no idea what job he will pursue. \u201cI\u2019ve got to figure out what do we do now,\u201d Wilson said Saturday night. \u201cRight now I would not want to be a cop, but you never know. Only time will tell.\u201dValerie Schremp Hahn of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.Bennie Currie of Chicago stands with his son Martin Garrett-Currie, 20 near the Ferguson police department on Saturday, Nov. 29, 2014. \"I didn't come here for the protest, I came her for Thanksgiving,\" said Garrett-Currie that his family comes every year to Ferguson because his mother is from there.
