Promise.\n\n\t\t\tReporter Charlo Greene quit on live TV during a broadcast last night on KTVA in Anchorage, Alaska. She helmed a segment, her very last segment, on the Alaska Cannabis Club last night, which is apparently the state's only medical marijuana resource. Its website adds that its business model \"finds a perfect balancing act with Alaska's Medical Marijuana laws, Alaska's constitutional protections and current local and state marijuana laws factored in.\" In other words, it acts as a go-between.And it turns out Greene is the club's CEO \u2014 a fact she had apparently not disclosed in any pre-show reporting [via Dazed & Confused]. As the cameras rolled, she outed herself, saying she plans to \"[dedicate] all my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska.\" \"And as for this job,\" she continued, noticeably nervous and a little emotional, \"not that I have a choice, but fuck it \u2013 I quit.\" Greene then walked off camera, and that was that. The camera quickly panned to a rather flabbergasted anchor who apologized for the profanity, and cut to a commercial.The Alaska Cannabis Club's Facebook page had prompted its followers to tune in for the show, though apparently no one knew of Greene's dramatic plans. (It's worth noting her phrasing \u2014 \"not that I have a choice\" \u2014 suggests her resignation may have been preceded at least by some newsroom politics/unpleasantness.) She has now launched an Indiegogo fundraising page to raise money, and awareness, for her cause. There, she writes:As a member of the media, I've seen the dirty campaign tricks and lies that prohibitionists have been using over the past several months to sway Alaskan voters firsthand. Here's the sad thing: it's working. Polling shows the majority of Alaskans, who were in favor of the initiative at the start of the year, are now against it.Few people fighting for marijuana legalization in Alaska are as media savvy, well educated on the marijuana industry, passionate, professional and completely dedicated to passing this initiative as me, the only person in Alaska that has had the balls to face the injustice of Alaska's medical marijuana catch-22 and do something about it. My Alaska Cannabis Club members are right here with me, ready to fight this long overdue fight.Also, the Club's logo is an igloo with a marijuana leaf inside.Follow Alex on Twitter."}
