{"id": "539254751343681536", "headline": "\nThe DeAndre Joshua Murder ", "content": "DeAndre Joshua, 20, was murdered on the same night of the Saint Louis Grand Jury announcement. DeAndre was shot in the head, and then a flammable liquid poured on him and set afire inside his vehicle.DeAndre Joshua also fits the social profile of several\u00a0eye-witnesses who gave the police/FBI statements and testified before the Grand Jury in the Mike Brown shooting case.\u00a0 If that were the only coincidence it might be easy to dismiss.\u00a0 Alas, it\u2019s not. Out of an abundance of caution for other witnesses we are avoiding outlining the most direct connections.\u00a0As you are aware DeAndre\u00a0 was an employed black male, with no history of drug use or illicit behavior.\u00a0 In the Canfield Community marijuana is not considered illicit, nor does weed really qualify as\u00a0drug use \u2013 it\u2019s as common as tobacco.\u00a0 DeAndre\u00a0was also a friend of Dorian Johnson who is currently under protection.Obviously his friend,\u00a0Dorian Johnson is very alarmed,\u00a0understandably so. On the\u00a0 night before the Grand Jury announcement, there were considerable nerves amid a select group in the Ferguson community.As the attention of a nation turned to the grand jury decision, and also to\u00a0the demands of the Justice for Mike Brown coalition, Dorian Johnson was potentially going to be the\u00a0recipient of a tremendous amount of angst.\u00a0 Several people were looking for DeAndre and Dorian.Dorian was in hiding \u2013 DeAndre was vulnerable.\nAnother witness who falls into this almost identical profile is Witness #35, who has been identified under the name \u201cViron\u201d.\u00a0 However, even the FBI agents who interviewed Viron are unsure of his actual identity.\nWitness #35 presented himself for FBI interview with an \u201cuncle\u201d, and a female attorney.\u00a0 When it came to identify himself, well, the ambiguity is almost unbelievable were it not documented by the federal authorities.\u00a0 (See Page #32)\nWitness #35 would not give his real name, nor his social security number, nor his address or contact information, and would only sign his statement with an alias.\nIn hindsight, and against the backdrop of the death of DeAndre\u00a0Joshua, the reluctance of Witness #35\u00a0might lead a researcher to understand\u00a0a\u00a0prescient fear was not unfounded.\nHowever, social media is identifying a profile that fits a connection to Dorian as described in the affidavit, Viron becomes\u00a0Devorion Livingston.\u00a0\u00a0 Devorion is a\u00a0friend to both eye-witness and robbery cohort Dorian Johnson, along with the murdered\u00a0DeAndre Joshua.\nGiven the relationships, the connections, and the documented associations, Devorion fits the profile of\u00a0Witness #35 who gave the painful to read testimony to the FBI where they were consistently reminding him, and warning him,\u00a0about the risks of lying about the events.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Witness #35\u00a0read his testimony here.\n\nDevorion Livingston is also pictured below\u00a0with Dorian Johnson last year at Canfield apartment complex.\u00a0 Note the vehicle in the background:DeAndre Joshua murder [\u2026]\u00a0 Authorities say a pile of broken glass and blood lay beside the\u00a0white Pontiac Grand Prix Joshua was found inside. (link)\nYes, that\u2019s a White Grand Prix behind Dorian Johnson (purple shirt) and Devorian Livingston.\nBoth Dorian Johnson and Devorion Livingston\u00a0found out about DeAndre\u2019s brutal murder\u00a0at approximately the same time.\nDorian Johnson, who is in protective custody, was understandably freaking out.\n\nBelow you can see how Devorion\u00a0Livingston payed homage to his now murdered friend the day he found out.\n\nApparently the three Canfield friends, Devorion, Dorian and DeAndre,\u00a0knew each other for quite some time.\nHowever, prior to the grand jury announcement Devorion Livingston and his pregnant wife (?) got the heck outta dodge Ferguson.\u00a0\u00a0 (click to enlarge and read the FB narrative)\n\nObviously DeAndre Joshua didn\u2019t leave Ferguson \u2013 he was murdered last Monday\u00a0in Canfield Greens Apartment complex, mere yards away from where Mike Brown was shot.\nSo the ultimate question becomes is this just mere coincidence?\u00a0 Dorian, Devorian and DeAndre being close friends.\u00a0 Dorian in hiding, Devorian having left town, and DeAndre now murdered.\u00a0\u00a0 A person would have to be exceptionally obtuse not to see the connections.\nBut if it\u2019s not a coincidence, then why?\nStreet Justice Rules \u2013 Witness #14 gives a chilling account of what would happen to these kids if they told the wrong story \u2013 and what were the risks.\nInitially Witness #14 talked to State investigators \u2013 however, in his August 12th statement he mentioned the false story surrounding the \u201chands up \u2013 don\u2019t shoot\u201d narrative;\u00a0\u00a0and the\u00a0 pressure from the community to tell lies in support of the construct\u00a0(read here).\nThat initial statement prompted the FBI to come and visit Witness #14\u00a0specifically to talk about that aspect of his statement.\nWithin the FBI interview\u00a0 -a day before he was scheduled to appear before the grand jury- Witness #14 tells the FBI not only about the \u201chand\u2019s up\u201d story being totally made up by the community, but also that Mike Brown\u2019s step-dad, Louis Head, was the enforcer to insure compliance (read here).\nApparently Louis Head was the threat to make sure that all of the witnesses in/around Canfield Greens Apartment complex\u00a0said the right things, the \u201chands up \u2013 don\u2019t shoot\u201d things.Louis Head was also the person who gained notoriety by climbing upon a vehicle and shouting\u00a0\u201cBurn This Bitch Down\u201d the night DeAndre was murdered\u2026\u2026. The night DeAndre Joshua was indeed \u201cburned down\u201d while seated in his Grand Prix.Witness #14 was scheduled to testify on September 25th at 10:30am.\u00a0 He never showed up.\nPerhaps these are all coincidences.\u00a0 Perhaps.\nHowever, perhaps Louis Head, and those of like-minded association,\u00a0also hold the greatest motive for anger toward Dorian Johnson, and as a consequence toward anyone who was unsuccessful at getting Justice for Mike Brown.\nSeveral of the eye-witnesses, who gave honest testimony to the Grand Jury, were, according to their own statements, warned immediately after the shooting to keep their mouths shut. All of the eye-witnesses were African American. If you read the reports the sense of fear about speaking the truth is overwhelming. Many, if not all, of the witness statements outlined in police reports, FBI reports, and later in Grand Jury testimony -who testified to the factual events as outlined by officer Wilson, and whose testimony fit the physical and forensic evidence- were threatened by the local Canfield Greens community.Was the murder of DeAndre Joshua an outcome of\u00a0 a broken street code?\u00a0 His family thinks so:(Via Daily Mail) A man has died during the Ferguson riots just yards from where Michael Brown was shot dead. Residents on Canfield Drive said that DeAndre Joshua, 20, was shot whilst in his car though police at the scene refused to confirm any details.DeAndre\u2019s grandmother Renita Towns said that \u2018somebody killed him\u2019 during the carnage.She said that he graduated Beaumont High School and that he was working in Wal-Mart.Family member Brian Joshua, 45, added: \u2018He was a good kid, he\u2019s gone to high school, he\u2019s got a job, he\u2019s not into drugs or any of that stuff.\u2018I only saw him yesterday morning. He was a smart guy, he spoke cleanly, he was positive\u2019.Police took away DeAndre\u2019s white Pontiac Grand Prix and interviewed witnesses around 11am.\u00a0 A woman in her 20s broke down in tears and said: \u2018I knew him, he was my twin\u2019.
