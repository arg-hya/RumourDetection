He added investigators \"will leave no stone unturned\".While the cause of the crash has not been determined, US Vice President Joe Biden cautiously suggested the crash was \"not an accident\" and that the jet had \"apparently blown out of the sky\", while a US official said that, while its origin was unclear, a surface-to-air missile was probably responsible.\"I say 'apparently' because we don't actually have all the details. I want to be sure of what I say. Apparently, shot down. Shot down, not an accident.

According to the General Staff of Ukrainian Armed Forces, the plane was shot down by the Russian Buk missile system as the liner was flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters.\"Ukraine has no long-range air defence missile systems in this area.\"The plane was shot down, because the Russian air defence systems was affording protection to Russian mercenaries and terrorists in this area.\"Ukraine will present the evidence of Russian military involvement into the Boeing crash.\"The leader of the terrorists Igor Girkin (Strelkov) immediately commented on the catastrophe, believing that it was the Ukrainian jet that crashed: 'In Torez An-26 was shot down, its crashes are lying somewhere near the coal mine \u201cProgress\u201d.
