This follows a pattern in which unwitting donors are charged multiple times, but always for a total of less than $100, which is a key trigger point for banks\u2019 internal action systems. Photo: Courtesy Carol MahreHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is stealing from her poorest supporters by purposefully and repeatedly overcharging them after they make what\u2019s supposed to be a one-time small donation through her official campaign website, multiple sources tell the Observer.\nThe overcharges are occurring so often that the fraud department at one of the nation\u2019s biggest banks receives up to 100 phone calls a day from Clinton\u2019s small donors asking for refunds for unauthorized charges to their bankcards made by Clinton\u2019s campaign. One elderly Clinton donor, who has been a victim of this fraud scheme, has filed a complaint with her state\u2019s attorney general and a representative from the office told her that they had forwarded her case to the Federal Election Commission.\n\u201cWe get up to a hundred calls a day from Hillary\u2019s low-income supporters complaining about multiple unauthorized charges,\u201d a source, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of job security, from the Wells Fargo fraud department told the Observer. The source claims that the Clinton campaign has been pulling this stunt since Spring of this year. The Hillary for America campaign will overcharge small donors by repeatedly charging small amounts such as $20 to the bankcards of donors who made a one-time donation. However, the Clinton campaign strategically doesn\u2019t overcharge these donors $100 or more because the bank would then be obligated to investigate the fraud.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t investigate fraudulent charges unless they are over $100,\u201d the fraud specialist explained. \u201cThe Clinton campaign knows this, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t see any charges over the $100 amount, they\u2019ll stop the charges just below $100. We\u2019ll see her campaign overcharge donors by $20, $40 or $60 but never more than $100.\u201d The source, who has worked for Wells Fargo for over 10 years, said that the total amount they refund customers on a daily basis who have been overcharged by Clinton\u2019s campaign \u201cvaries\u201d but the bank usually issues refunds that total between $700 and $1,200 per day.\nThe fraud specialist said that Clinton donors who call in will attempt to resolve the issue with the campaign first but they never get anywhere. \u201cThey will call the Clinton campaign to get their refund and the issue never gets resolved. So they call us and we just issue the refund. The Clinton campaign knows these charges are small potatoes and that we\u2019ll just refund the money back.\u201d\nThe source said that pornography companies often deploy a similar arrangement pull. \u201cWe see this same scheme with a lot of seedy porn companies,\u201d the source said. The source also notes that the dozens of phone calls his department receives daily are from people who notice the fraudulent charges on their statements. \u201cThe people who call us are just the ones who catch the fraudulent charges. I can\u2019t imagine how many more people are getting overcharged by Hillary\u2019s campaign and they have no idea.\u201d\nThe source said he\u2019s apolitical but noted that the bank\u2019s fraud department is yet to receive one call from a Donald Trump supporter claiming to have been overcharged by Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cI\u2019m only talking to you because what Hillary\u2019s doing is so messed up, she\u2019s stealing from her poorest supporters.\u201d\nCarol Mahre has been charged multiple times after signing up for a one-time donation. Her son, Roger Mahre, is an attorney who filed a complaint with Minnesota\u2019s attorney general. Photo: Courtesy Carol Mahre\nWells Fargo recently came under fire after news broke that various regulators fined the big bank $185 million for opening 2 million phony customer accounts without their customers\u2019 permission. This massive scandal resulted in the firing of 5,300 Wells Fargo employees.\nCarol Mahre, an 81-year-old grandmother of seven from Minnesota, is one of the victims of Clinton\u2019s campaign donor fraud scandal. In March, Mahre said she made a one-time $25 donation via Clinton\u2019s official campaign website. However, when she received her U.S. Bank card statement, she noticed multiple $25 charges were made. Mahre, who said in an interview she only contributed $25 because she\u2019s \u201cnot rich\u201d and that\u2019s all she could afford, contacted her son, Roger Mahre, to help her dispute the unauthorized charges.\nRoger, who is an attorney, told the Observer that he called the Clinton campaign dozens of times in April and early May in an attempt to resolve the issue. \u201cIt took me at least 40 to 50 phone calls to the campaign office before I finally got ahold of someone,\u201d Roger said. \u201cAfter I got a campaign worker on the phone, she said they would stop making the charges.\u201d\nIncredibly, the very next day, Carol\u2019s card was charged yet again and the campaign had never reversed the initial fraudulent charges. \u201cI was told they would stop charging my mother\u2019s card but they never stopped.\u201d He added that he knows his mother did not sign up for recurring payments. \u201cShe\u2019s very good with the internet so I know she only made a one-time payment.\u201d Roger also pointed out that even if his mother mistakenly signed up for recurring monthly payments then she should\u2019ve been charged for the same amount of money each month, not multiple charges for varying amounts on the same day or in the same month. Furthermore, Roger said that after the campaign was made aware of this situation, the charges should\u2019ve stopped but they never did.\nThe Clinton campaign overcharged Carol $25 three times and then overcharged her one time for $19, a grand total of $94 in fraudulent charges. The campaign\u2019s overcharges to Carol were just a few dollars short of $100. This is in line with what the Wells Fargo bank source revealed to the Observer.\nSince the campaign failed to amend the problem for Carol, Roger contacted her bank, U.S. Bank. However, he ran into problems when he asked U.S. Bank to refund his mother\u2019s money. Roger told the Observer that the bank would not reverse the charges and that a bank spokesperson told him that they had no control over companies that make unauthorized charges. At that point, Roger decided to contact his local news and filed a fraud complaint with Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson\u2019s office on behalf of his mother. After local TV news Kare 11 ran a story, someone from U.S. Bank contacted Roger the next day and said that they had reversed and stopped the charges to his mother\u2019s card.\nA representative from Minnesota\u2019s Democratic attorney general\u2019s office told Roger that this problem wasn\u2019t in their jurisdiction and that they had forwarded the case to the FEC. However, FEC spokesperson Julia Queen told the Observer they have no record of the case. \u201cWe don\u2019t have it,\u201d Queen said. The Observer contacted Swanson\u2019s office and did not hear back.\nRoger did eventually get a letter from a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign. In the letter, the lawyer wrote that his mother would be removed from their donor list; however, the campaign did not take any responsibility for the fraudulent charges.\n\u201cThey basically said that they weren\u2019t accepting responsibility for this but they\u2019d remove my mom from the donor list,\u201d he said. Roger is less than happy with the way the Clinton campaign has handled this nightmare for him and his mother. \u201cThis is a load of crap!\u201d Mahre said. \u201cThe self-righteousness of politicians drives me insane. If you and I did this, we\u2019d be thrown in jail. This is theft, fraud or wire fraud\u2014it\u2019s a federal crime!\u201d\nSince Carol\u2019s story became public, Roger said he\u2019s heard from other people who have been ripped off by the Clinton campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this is happening to other small donors,\u201d Roger said. \u201cPeople will donate $25, but then when they receive their credit card statement, they are charged $25 multiple times.\u201d\nThe incident hasn\u2019t just left a bad taste in Roger\u2019s mouth. Carol decided she\u2019s not going to vote for Hillary even though she\u2019s voted for the Democratic presidential nominee every election since President Dwight Eisenhower won reelection in 1956. \u201cMy mother is a lifelong Democrat and she\u2019s voted every election in her life for a Democrat but she\u2019s not going to vote for Hillary,\u201d Roger said.\nThe New York Times reported in 2007 that Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign had to refund and subtract hundreds of thousands of dollars from its first-quarter total often because donors\u2019 credit cards were charged twice. Additionally, it was reported that Clinton had to refund a stunning $2.8 million in donations, three times more than the $900K President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign refunded.\nAnother bank source told the Observer that Clinton\u2019s motivation in purposefully overcharging donors is not only to rake in more money for her campaign but also to inflate her small donor numbers reported to the FEC. \u201cThis gives a false impression about how much money Clinton has raised,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe money that the bank has refunded would not be reflected in the FEC filings till after the election. This gives off the illusion to the public that her support and the amount she\u2019s raised is much greater than what it is in reality.\u201d\nA Clinton campaign worker named Kathy Callahan, who worked on Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008, claimed in a blog post that Clinton fraudulently overcharged her by several thousand dollars. She wrote that she voluntarily left the campaign\u2019s finance committee after she discovered $3,000 in unauthorized charges made by Clinton\u2019s campaign to her Visa card. Callahan said the unauthorized charges caused $400 in overdraft and bank charges and put Callahan over the legal donor limit. Callahan said that after a month of \u201cbegging and pleading,\u201d she wasn\u2019t able to get her money back until she threatened to go to authorities. However, when she was finally refunded her money the Clinton campaign refused to compensate her for the $400 in overdraft and bank charges.\nCallahan also wrote that Matt McQueeney, who worked in the compliance and accounting department at Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters at the time, told her, \u201cWhat happened to you with credit card errors is happening to others.\u201d McQueeney reportedly parted ways with the Clinton campaign shortly after this incident occurred. Backing up what McQueeney claimed, there were several incidents similar to Callahan\u2019s reported in 2008. Callahan and McQueeney could not be reached for comment.\nIn 2001, the Clintons were accused of attempting to steal items donated to the White House during Bill\u2019s presidency as he exited office. There was $190,000 worth of gifts in question that the Clintons shipped to their then new estate in Chappaqua, New York. Multiple donors said that they had understood that the items they had donated during Clinton\u2019s presidency were to stay in the White House as part of the 1993 White House redecoration project. Initially, the Clintons claimed that the items in question were given to them prior to President Clinton taking office; however, government records proved otherwise. Facing strong criticism, the Clintons decided to return several items including $28,500 in furnishings and they paid $86,000 for other gifts.\nMurmurs of theft are nothing new to the Clintons. But Bill begs to differ.\nHe recently compared himself to Robin Hood and said that through their foundation he asks people with money to give to people who don\u2019t have money. In reality, the Clintons steal from people who have little money and they\u2019re robbing some of Hillary\u2019s most impoverished supporters\u2014including a poor elderly grandma\u2014to fund her campaign.\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.\n\nThe overcharges are occurring so often that the fraud department at one of the nation\u2019s biggest banks receives up to 100 phone calls a day from Clinton\u2019s small donors asking for refunds for unauthorized charges to their bankcards made by Clinton\u2019s campaign.

Carol decided she\u2019s not going to vote for Hillary even though she\u2019s voted for the Democratic presidential nominee every election since President Dwight Eisenhower won reelection in 1956. \u201cMy mother is a lifelong Democrat and she\u2019s voted every election in her life for a Democrat but she\u2019s not going to vote for Hillary,\u201d Roger said.\nThe New York Times reported in 2007 that Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign had to refund and subtract hundreds of thousands of dollars from its first-quarter total often because donors\u2019 credit cards were charged twice. Additionally, it was reported that Clinton had to refund a stunning $2.8 million in donations, three times more than the $900K President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign refunded.\nAnother bank source told the Observer that Clinton\u2019s motivation in purposefully overcharging donors is not only to rake in more money for her campaign but also to inflate her small donor numbers reported to the FEC. \u201cThis gives a false impression about how much money Clinton has raised,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe money that the bank has refunded would not be reflected in the FEC filings till after the election. This gives off the illusion to the public that her support and the amount she\u2019s raised is much greater than what it is in reality.\u201d\nA Clinton campaign worker named Kathy Callahan, who worked on Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008, claimed in a blog post that Clinton fraudulently overcharged her by several thousand dollars. She wrote that she voluntarily left the campaign\u2019s finance committee after she discovered $3,000 in unauthorized charges made by Clinton\u2019s campaign to her Visa card. Callahan said the unauthorized charges caused $400 in overdraft and bank charges and put Callahan over the legal donor limit. Callahan said that after a month of \u201cbegging and pleading,\u201d she wasn\u2019t able to get her money back until she threatened to go to authorities. However, when she was finally refunded her money the Clinton campaign refused to compensate her for the $400 in overdraft and bank charges.\nCallahan also wrote that Matt McQueeney, who worked in the compliance and accounting department at Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters at the time, told her, \u201cWhat happened to you with credit card errors is happening to others.\u201d McQueeney reportedly parted ways with the Clinton campaign shortly after this incident occurred. Backing up what McQueeney claimed, there were several incidents similar to Callahan\u2019s reported in 2008. Callahan and McQueeney could not be reached for comment.\nIn 2001, the Clintons were accused of attempting to steal items donated to the White House during Bill\u2019s presidency as he exited office. There was $190,000 worth of gifts in question that the Clintons shipped to their then new estate in Chappaqua, New York. Multiple donors said that they had understood that the items they had donated during Clinton\u2019s presidency were to stay in the White House as part of the 1993 White House redecoration project. Initially, the Clintons claimed that the items in question were given to them prior to President Clinton taking office; however, government records proved otherwise. Facing strong criticism, the Clintons decided to return several items including $28,500 in furnishings and they paid $86,000 for other gifts.\nMurmurs of theft are nothing new to the Clintons. But Bill begs to differ.\nHe recently compared himself to Robin Hood and said that through their foundation he asks people with money to give to people who don\u2019t have money. In reality, the Clintons steal from people who have little money and they\u2019re robbing some of Hillary\u2019s most impoverished supporters\u2014including a poor elderly grandma\u2014to fund her campaign.\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t investigate fraudulent charges unless they are over $100,\u201d the fraud specialist explained. \u201cThe Clinton campaign knows this, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t see any charges over the $100 amount, they\u2019ll stop the charges just below $100. We\u2019ll see her campaign overcharge donors by $20, $40 or $60 but never more than $100.\u201d The source, who has worked for Wells Fargo for over 10 years, said that the total amount they refund customers on a daily basis who have been overcharged by Clinton\u2019s campaign \u201cvaries\u201d but the bank usually issues refunds that total between $700 and $1,200 per day.\nThe fraud specialist said that Clinton donors who call in will attempt to resolve the issue with the campaign first but they never get anywhere. \u201cThey will call the Clinton campaign to get their refund and the issue never gets resolved. So they call us and we just issue the refund. The Clinton campaign knows these charges are small potatoes and that we\u2019ll just refund the money back.\u201d\nThe source said that pornography companies often deploy a similar arrangement pull. \u201cWe see this same scheme with a lot of seedy porn companies,\u201d the source said. The source also notes that the dozens of phone calls his department receives daily are from people who notice the fraudulent charges on their statements. \u201cThe people who call us are just the ones who catch the fraudulent charges. I can\u2019t imagine how many more people are getting overcharged by Hillary\u2019s campaign and they have no idea.\u201d\nThe source said he\u2019s apolitical but noted that the bank\u2019s fraud department is yet to receive one call from a Donald Trump supporter claiming to have been overcharged by Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cI\u2019m only talking to you because what Hillary\u2019s doing is so messed up, she\u2019s stealing from her poorest supporters.\u201d\nCarol Mahre has been charged multiple times after signing up for a one-time donation.

Photo: Courtesy Carol Mahre\nWells Fargo recently came under fire after news broke that various regulators fined the big bank $185 million for opening 2 million phony customer accounts without their customers\u2019 permission. This massive scandal resulted in the firing of 5,300 Wells Fargo employees.\nCarol Mahre, an 81-year-old grandmother of seven from Minnesota, is one of the victims of Clinton\u2019s campaign donor fraud scandal. In March, Mahre said she made a one-time $25 donation via Clinton\u2019s official campaign website. However, when she received her U.S. Bank card statement, she noticed multiple $25 charges were made. Mahre, who said in an interview she only contributed $25 because she\u2019s \u201cnot rich\u201d and that\u2019s all she could afford, contacted her son, Roger Mahre, to help her dispute the unauthorized charges.\nRoger, who is an attorney, told the Observer that he called the Clinton campaign dozens of times in April and early May in an attempt to resolve the issue. \u201cIt took me at least 40 to 50 phone calls to the campaign office before I finally got ahold of someone,\u201d Roger said. \u201cAfter I got a campaign worker on the phone, she said they would stop making the charges.\u201d\nIncredibly, the very next day, Carol\u2019s card was charged yet again and the campaign had never reversed the initial fraudulent charges. \u201cI was told they would stop charging my mother\u2019s card but they never stopped.\u201d He added that he knows his mother did not sign up for recurring payments. \u201cShe\u2019s very good with the internet so I know she only made a one-time payment.\u201d Roger also pointed out that even if his mother mistakenly signed up for recurring monthly payments then she should\u2019ve been charged for the same amount of money each month, not multiple charges for varying amounts on the same day or in the same month. Furthermore, Roger said that after the campaign was made aware of this situation, the charges should\u2019ve stopped but they never did.\nThe Clinton campaign overcharged Carol $25 three times and then overcharged her one time for $19, a grand total of $94 in fraudulent charges. The campaign\u2019s overcharges to Carol were just a few dollars short of $100. This is in line with what the Wells Fargo bank source revealed to the Observer.\nSince the campaign failed to amend the problem for Carol, Roger contacted her bank, U.S. Bank. However, he ran into problems when he asked U.S. Bank to refund his mother\u2019s money. Roger told the Observer that the bank would not reverse the charges and that a bank spokesperson told him that they had no control over companies that make unauthorized charges. At that point, Roger decided to contact his local news and filed a fraud complaint with Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson\u2019s office on behalf of his mother. After local TV news Kare 11 ran a story, someone from U.S. Bank contacted Roger the next day and said that they had reversed and stopped the charges to his mother\u2019s card.\nA representative from Minnesota\u2019s Democratic attorney general\u2019s office told Roger that this problem wasn\u2019t in their jurisdiction and that they had forwarded the case to the FEC.

In the letter, the lawyer wrote that his mother would be removed from their donor list; however, the campaign did not take any responsibility for the fraudulent charges.\n\u201cThey basically said that they weren\u2019t accepting responsibility for this but they\u2019d remove my mom from the donor list,\u201d he said. Roger is less than happy with the way the Clinton campaign has handled this nightmare for him and his mother. \u201cThis is a load of crap!\u201d Mahre said. \u201cThe self-righteousness of politicians drives me insane. If you and I did this, we\u2019d be thrown in jail. This is theft, fraud or wire fraud\u2014it\u2019s a federal crime!\u201d\nSince Carol\u2019s story became public, Roger said he\u2019s heard from other people who have been ripped off by the Clinton campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this is happening to other small donors,\u201d Roger said. \u201cPeople will donate $25, but then when they receive their credit card statement, they are charged $25 multiple times.\u201d\nThe incident hasn\u2019t just left a bad taste in Roger\u2019s mouth. Carol decided she\u2019s not going to vote for Hillary even though she\u2019s voted for the Democratic presidential nominee every election since President Dwight Eisenhower won reelection in 1956. \u201cMy mother is a lifelong Democrat and she\u2019s voted every election in her life for a Democrat but she\u2019s not going to vote for Hillary,\u201d Roger said.\nThe New York Times reported in 2007 that Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign had to refund and subtract hundreds of thousands of dollars from its first-quarter total often because donors\u2019 credit cards were charged twice. Additionally, it was reported that Clinton had to refund a stunning $2.8 million in donations, three times more than the $900K President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign refunded.\nAnother bank source told the Observer that Clinton\u2019s motivation in purposefully overcharging donors is not only to rake in more money for her campaign but also to inflate her small donor numbers reported to the FEC. \u201cThis gives a false impression about how much money Clinton has raised,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe money that the bank has refunded would not be reflected in the FEC filings till after the election. This gives off the illusion to the public that her support and the amount she\u2019s raised is much greater than what it is in reality.\u201d\nA Clinton campaign worker named Kathy Callahan, who worked on Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008, claimed in a blog post that Clinton fraudulently overcharged her by several thousand dollars. She wrote that she voluntarily left the campaign\u2019s finance committee after she discovered $3,000 in unauthorized charges made by Clinton\u2019s campaign to her Visa card. Callahan said the unauthorized charges caused $400 in overdraft and bank charges and put Callahan over the legal donor limit. Callahan said that after a month of \u201cbegging and pleading,\u201d she wasn\u2019t able to get her money back until she threatened to go to authorities. However, when she was finally refunded her money the Clinton campaign refused to compensate her for the $400 in overdraft and bank charges.\nCallahan also wrote that Matt McQueeney, who worked in the compliance and accounting department at Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters at the time, told her, \u201cWhat happened to you with credit card errors is happening to others.\u201d McQueeney reportedly parted ways with the Clinton campaign shortly after this incident occurred. Backing up what McQueeney claimed, there were several incidents similar to Callahan\u2019s reported in 2008. Callahan and McQueeney could not be reached for comment.\nIn 2001, the Clintons were accused of attempting to steal items donated to the White House during Bill\u2019s presidency as he exited office. There was $190,000 worth of gifts in question that the Clintons shipped to their then new estate in Chappaqua, New York. Multiple donors said that they had understood that the items they had donated during Clinton\u2019s presidency were to stay in the White House as part of the 1993 White House redecoration project. Initially, the Clintons claimed that the items in question were given to them prior to President Clinton taking office; however, government records proved otherwise. Facing strong criticism, the Clintons decided to return several items including $28,500 in furnishings and they paid $86,000 for other gifts.\nMurmurs of theft are nothing new to the Clintons. But Bill begs to differ.\nHe recently compared himself to Robin Hood and said that through their foundation he asks people with money to give to people who don\u2019t have money. In reality, the Clintons steal from people who have little money and they\u2019re robbing some of Hillary\u2019s most impoverished supporters\u2014including a poor elderly grandma\u2014to fund her campaign.\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.\n\nThe source said he\u2019s apolitical but noted that the bank\u2019s fraud department is yet to receive one call from a Donald Trump supporter claiming to have been overcharged by Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cI\u2019m only talking to you because what Hillary\u2019s doing is so messed up, she\u2019s stealing from her poorest supporters.\u201d\nCarol Mahre has been charged multiple times after signing up for a one-time donation. Her son, Roger Mahre, is an attorney who filed a complaint with Minnesota\u2019s attorney general. Photo: Courtesy Carol Mahre\nWells Fargo recently came under fire after news broke that various regulators fined the big bank $185 million for opening 2 million phony customer accounts without their customers\u2019 permission. This massive scandal resulted in the firing of 5,300 Wells Fargo employees.\nCarol Mahre, an 81-year-old grandmother of seven from Minnesota, is one of the victims of Clinton\u2019s campaign donor fraud scandal. In March, Mahre said she made a one-time $25 donation via Clinton\u2019s official campaign website. However, when she received her U.S. Bank card statement, she noticed multiple $25 charges were made. Mahre, who said in an interview she only contributed $25 because she\u2019s \u201cnot rich\u201d and that\u2019s all she could afford, contacted her son, Roger Mahre, to help her dispute the unauthorized charges.\nRoger, who is an attorney, told the Observer that he called the Clinton campaign dozens of times in April and early May in an attempt to resolve the issue. \u201cIt took me at least 40 to 50 phone calls to the campaign office before I finally got ahold of someone,\u201d Roger said. \u201cAfter I got a campaign worker on the phone, she said they would stop making the charges.\u201d\nIncredibly, the very next day, Carol\u2019s card was charged yet again and the campaign had never reversed the initial fraudulent charges. \u201cI was told they would stop charging my mother\u2019s card but they never stopped.\u201d He added that he knows his mother did not sign up for recurring payments. \u201cShe\u2019s very good with the internet so I know she only made a one-time payment.\u201d Roger also pointed out that even if his mother mistakenly signed up for recurring monthly payments then she should\u2019ve been charged for the same amount of money each month, not multiple charges for varying amounts on the same day or in the same month. Furthermore, Roger said that after the campaign was made aware of this situation, the charges should\u2019ve stopped but they never did.\nThe Clinton campaign overcharged Carol $25 three times and then overcharged her one time for $19, a grand total of $94 in fraudulent charges. The campaign\u2019s overcharges to Carol were just a few dollars short of $100. This is in line with what the Wells Fargo bank source revealed to the Observer.\nSince the campaign failed to amend the problem for Carol, Roger contacted her bank, U.S. Bank. However, he ran into problems when he asked U.S. Bank to refund his mother\u2019s money. Roger told the Observer that the bank would not reverse the charges and that a bank spokesperson told him that they had no control over companies that make unauthorized charges. At that point, Roger decided to contact his local news and filed a fraud complaint with Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson\u2019s office on behalf of his mother. After local TV news Kare 11 ran a story, someone from U.S. Bank contacted Roger the next day and said that they had reversed and stopped the charges to his mother\u2019s card.\nA representative from Minnesota\u2019s Democratic attorney general\u2019s office told Roger that this problem wasn\u2019t in their jurisdiction and that they had forwarded the case to the FEC.

But Bill begs to differ.\nHe recently compared himself to Robin Hood and said that through their foundation he asks people with money to give to people who don\u2019t have money. In reality, the Clintons steal from people who have little money and they\u2019re robbing some of Hillary\u2019s most impoverished supporters\u2014including a poor elderly grandma\u2014to fund her campaign.\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.\n\nRoger, who is an attorney, told the Observer that he called the Clinton campaign dozens of times in April and early May in an attempt to resolve the issue. \u201cIt took me at least 40 to 50 phone calls to the campaign office before I finally got ahold of someone,\u201d Roger said. \u201cAfter I got a campaign worker on the phone, she said they would stop making the charges.\u201d\nIncredibly, the very next day, Carol\u2019s card was charged yet again and the campaign had never reversed the initial fraudulent charges. \u201cI was told they would stop charging my mother\u2019s card but they never stopped.\u201d He added that he knows his mother did not sign up for recurring payments. \u201cShe\u2019s very good with the internet so I know she only made a one-time payment.\u201d Roger also pointed out that even if his mother mistakenly signed up for recurring monthly payments then she should\u2019ve been charged for the same amount of money each month, not multiple charges for varying amounts on the same day or in the same month. Furthermore, Roger said that after the campaign was made aware of this situation, the charges should\u2019ve stopped but they never did.\nThe Clinton campaign overcharged Carol $25 three times and then overcharged her one time for $19, a grand total of $94 in fraudulent charges. The campaign\u2019s overcharges to Carol were just a few dollars short of $100. This is in line with what the Wells Fargo bank source revealed to the Observer.\nSince the campaign failed to amend the problem for Carol, Roger contacted her bank, U.S. Bank. However, he ran into problems when he asked U.S. Bank to refund his mother\u2019s money. Roger told the Observer that the bank would not reverse the charges and that a bank spokesperson told him that they had no control over companies that make unauthorized charges. At that point, Roger decided to contact his local news and filed a fraud complaint with Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson\u2019s office on behalf of his mother. After local TV news Kare 11 ran a story, someone from U.S. Bank contacted Roger the next day and said that they had reversed and stopped the charges to his mother\u2019s card.\nA representative from Minnesota\u2019s Democratic attorney general\u2019s office told Roger that this problem wasn\u2019t in their jurisdiction and that they had forwarded the case to the FEC. However, FEC spokesperson Julia Queen told the Observer they have no record of the case. \u201cWe don\u2019t have it,\u201d Queen said. The Observer contacted Swanson\u2019s office and did not hear back.\nRoger did eventually get a letter from a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign. In the letter, the lawyer wrote that his mother would be removed from their donor list; however, the campaign did not take any responsibility for the fraudulent charges.\n\u201cThey basically said that they weren\u2019t accepting responsibility for this but they\u2019d remove my mom from the donor list,\u201d he said. Roger is less than happy with the way the Clinton campaign has handled this nightmare for him and his mother. \u201cThis is a load of crap!\u201d Mahre said. \u201cThe self-righteousness of politicians drives me insane. If you and I did this, we\u2019d be thrown in jail. This is theft, fraud or wire fraud\u2014it\u2019s a federal crime!\u201d\nSince Carol\u2019s story became public, Roger said he\u2019s heard from other people who have been ripped off by the Clinton campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this is happening to other small donors,\u201d Roger said. \u201cPeople will donate $25, but then when they receive their credit card statement, they are charged $25 multiple times.\u201d\nThe incident hasn\u2019t just left a bad taste in Roger\u2019s mouth. Carol decided she\u2019s not going to vote for Hillary even though she\u2019s voted for the Democratic presidential nominee every election since President Dwight Eisenhower won reelection in 1956. \u201cMy mother is a lifelong Democrat and she\u2019s voted every election in her life for a Democrat but she\u2019s not going to vote for Hillary,\u201d Roger said.\nThe New York Times reported in 2007 that Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign had to refund and subtract hundreds of thousands of dollars from its first-quarter total often because donors\u2019 credit cards were charged twice. Additionally, it was reported that Clinton had to refund a stunning $2.8 million in donations, three times more than the $900K President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign refunded.\nAnother bank source told the Observer that Clinton\u2019s motivation in purposefully overcharging donors is not only to rake in more money for her campaign but also to inflate her small donor numbers reported to the FEC. \u201cThis gives a false impression about how much money Clinton has raised,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe money that the bank has refunded would not be reflected in the FEC filings till after the election. This gives off the illusion to the public that her support and the amount she\u2019s raised is much greater than what it is in reality.\u201d\nA Clinton campaign worker named Kathy Callahan, who worked on Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008, claimed in a blog post that Clinton fraudulently overcharged her by several thousand dollars. She wrote that she voluntarily left the campaign\u2019s finance committee after she discovered $3,000 in unauthorized charges made by Clinton\u2019s campaign to her Visa card. Callahan said the unauthorized charges caused $400 in overdraft and bank charges and put Callahan over the legal donor limit. Callahan said that after a month of \u201cbegging and pleading,\u201d she wasn\u2019t able to get her money back until she threatened to go to authorities. However, when she was finally refunded her money the Clinton campaign refused to compensate her for the $400 in overdraft and bank charges.\nCallahan also wrote that Matt McQueeney, who worked in the compliance and accounting department at Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters at the time, told her, \u201cWhat happened to you with credit card errors is happening to others.\u201d McQueeney reportedly parted ways with the Clinton campaign shortly after this incident occurred. Backing up what McQueeney claimed, there were several incidents similar to Callahan\u2019s reported in 2008. Callahan and McQueeney could not be reached for comment.\nIn 2001, the Clintons were accused of attempting to steal items donated to the White House during Bill\u2019s presidency as he exited office. There was $190,000 worth of gifts in question that the Clintons shipped to their then new estate in Chappaqua, New York. Multiple donors said that they had understood that the items they had donated during Clinton\u2019s presidency were to stay in the White House as part of the 1993 White House redecoration project. Initially, the Clintons claimed that the items in question were given to them prior to President Clinton taking office; however, government records proved otherwise.

Additionally, it was reported that Clinton had to refund a stunning $2.8 million in donations, three times more than the $900K President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign refunded.\nAnother bank source told the Observer that Clinton\u2019s motivation in purposefully overcharging donors is not only to rake in more money for her campaign but also to inflate her small donor numbers reported to the FEC. \u201cThis gives a false impression about how much money Clinton has raised,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe money that the bank has refunded would not be reflected in the FEC filings till after the election.

She wrote that she voluntarily left the campaign\u2019s finance committee after she discovered $3,000 in unauthorized charges made by Clinton\u2019s campaign to her Visa card. Callahan said the unauthorized charges caused $400 in overdraft and bank charges and put Callahan over the legal donor limit. Callahan said that after a month of \u201cbegging and pleading,\u201d she wasn\u2019t able to get her money back until she threatened to go to authorities. However, when she was finally refunded her money the Clinton campaign refused to compensate her for the $400 in overdraft and bank charges.\nCallahan also wrote that Matt McQueeney, who worked in the compliance and accounting department at Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters at the time, told her, \u201cWhat happened to you with credit card errors is happening to others.\u201d McQueeney reportedly parted ways with the Clinton campaign shortly after this incident occurred. Backing up what McQueeney claimed, there were several incidents similar to Callahan\u2019s reported in 2008. Callahan and McQueeney could not be reached for comment.\nIn 2001, the Clintons were accused of attempting to steal items donated to the White House during Bill\u2019s presidency as he exited office. There was $190,000 worth of gifts in question that the Clintons shipped to their then new estate in Chappaqua, New York. Multiple donors said that they had understood that the items they had donated during Clinton\u2019s presidency were to stay in the White House as part of the 1993 White House redecoration project. Initially, the Clintons claimed that the items in question were given to them prior to President Clinton taking office; however, government records proved otherwise. Facing strong criticism, the Clintons decided to return several items including $28,500 in furnishings and they paid $86,000 for other gifts.\nMurmurs of theft are nothing new to the Clintons. But Bill begs to differ.\nHe recently compared himself to Robin Hood and said that through their foundation he asks people with money to give to people who don\u2019t have money. In reality, the Clintons steal from people who have little money and they\u2019re robbing some of Hillary\u2019s most impoverished supporters\u2014including a poor elderly grandma\u2014to fund her campaign.\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.\n\nRoger did eventually get a letter from a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign. In the letter, the lawyer wrote that his mother would be removed from their donor list; however, the campaign did not take any responsibility for the fraudulent charges.\n\u201cThey basically said that they weren\u2019t accepting responsibility for this but they\u2019d remove my mom from the donor list,\u201d he said. Roger is less than happy with the way the Clinton campaign has handled this nightmare for him and his mother. \u201cThis is a load of crap!\u201d Mahre said. \u201cThe self-righteousness of politicians drives me insane.
