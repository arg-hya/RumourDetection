Amber Alert website goes dark under government shutdown; Updated\n", "content": "\nPosted at 8:09 pm on October 6, 2013 by Brett T.\nWe\u2019ll hope for now that actual Amber Alerts will continue to freak out unsuspecting iPhone owners and get results in locating abducted children, but it looks like AmberAlert.gov has fallen victim to the government shutdown. Here\u2019s what AmberAlert.gov looks like at the moment:If it would save just one child, would it be considered essential?Obama turns off Amber Alert website. Because that \"if it saves just one child\" was all talk. http://t.co/y4nN9eTxd1\u2014 Razor (@hale_razor) October 6, 2013How about the gun control theatrics \"if it saves just one child\" then shutting down Amber alert\u2026optics couldn't be worse POTUS. Keep it up\u2014 Rochelle (@rbostick12) October 7, 2013@hale_razor what a douche bag. Get him him out of our house\u2014 glozee (@glozee1) October 6, 2013Blocking WWII vets: essential. Funding the Amber Alert site: nonessential.\u2014 Razor (@hale_razor) October 6, 2013No, seriously, the petty bastards in the Obama Administration turned off the Amber Alert website http://t.co/CIzOSVkNv2\u2014 Dr. Jason B. Whitman (@JasonBWhitman) October 6, 2013@JasonBWhitman unbelievable\u2014 Natalie_Page (@Natalie_Page) October 6, 2013@JasonBWhitman I thought they were low to block ppl from the WW2 memorial. Do states have their own Amber Alerts, I hope?\u2014 Laura McGinnis (@Txsleuthe) October 6, 2013@JasonBWhitman @debra0827 don't save a cent turning off most websites- the hosting cost continues, most don't require daily updates\u2014 Grumpy Elder (@Grumpyelder) October 6, 2013@Grumpyelder @JasonBWhitman @debra0827 It's not $ it's Chicago-thug Democrat abuse of power. Spent $ blocking access to open mouments!\u2014 Middlepeople \u2013 David (@dmc2et) October 6, 2013@hale_razor All 436 Democrat Obama staff, incl 2 chefs, more \"essential\" than Amber Alert for missing children? First 48hrs are critical!\u2014 Middlepeople \u2013 David (@dmc2et) October 6, 2013Probably not a super idea for the Administration to temporarily disable the Amber Alert system.\u2014 Jeffrey Goldberg (@JeffreyGoldberg) October 6, 2013Effective govt at work \u2013> Deeming the folks who run the Amber Alert page as non-essential. Stupid as hell or dick move? Hard to tell w/Dems\u2014 LMR (@LilMissRightie) October 6, 2013Shutting down the Amber Alert website? There really is no bottom of the barrel for this administration, is there?\u2014 Peter Cook (@Slublog) October 6, 2013TrendingNope.

Is there any diabolical action you WON'T defend? #p2\u2014 Dr. Jason B. Whitman (@JasonBWhitman) October 6, 2013Dear @BarackObama, Barricading open-air war memorials was a tacky new low; shutting down http://t.co/MOWAht1khc is beyond foolish. It's vile\u2014 Will Antonin (@Will_Antonin) October 7, 2013So how many barricades would the administration have had to not put up in order to afford to keep the Amber Alert Web site operating?\u2014 Justin Katz (@JustinKatzRI) October 7, 2013Barack Obama has DOJ shut down the Amber Alert system\u2026So, we can add dead kids to the lengths he's is willing to go in his shutdown game.\u2014 Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) October 7, 2013By all means, let's turn over healthcare decision making to people willing to shut down the Amber Alert website out of spite.\u2014 Dr. Jason B. Whitman (@JasonBWhitman) October 7, 2013So, the president didn\u2019t golf this weekend because it would look bad, so instead he stayed in the White House and ordered AmberAlert.gov taken down?#Amberalert website is down. THAT is under direct control of the OMB.
