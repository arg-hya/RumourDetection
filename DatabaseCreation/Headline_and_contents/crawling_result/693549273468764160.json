Her odyssey began when she fell in love against her family\u2019s wishes and ran off to marry her boyfriend. Hours after the marriage, her father and uncle sweet-talked her into their car and took her to a spot along a riverbank to murder her for her defiance \u2014 an \u201chonor killing.\u201dFirst they beat Saba, then her uncle held her as her own father pointed a pistol at her head and pulled the trigger. Blood spewed, Saba collapsed and her father and uncle packed her body into a large sack and threw it into the river to sink. They then drove away, thinking they had restored the family\u2019s good name. Incredibly, Saba was unconscious but alive. She had jerked her head as the gun went off, and the bullet tore through the left side of her face but didn\u2019t kill her. The river water revived her, and she clawed her way out of the sack and crawled onto land. She staggered toward a gasoline station, and someone called for help.About every 90 minutes, an honor killing unfolds somewhere in the world, usually in a Muslim country. Pakistan alone has more than 1,000 a year, and the killers often go unpunished.Watching the documentary about Saba, \u201cA Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness,\u201d I kept thinking that just as in the 19th century the central moral challenge for the world was slavery, and in the 20th century it was totalitarianism, in this century the foremost moral issue is the abuse and oppression that is the lot of so many women and girls around the world.I don\u2019t know whether \u201cA Girl in the River\u201d will win an Oscar in its category, short subject documentary, but it is already making a difference. Citing the film, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan has promised to change the country\u2019s laws so as to crack down on honor killings.Saba\u2019s story underscores how the existing law lets people literally get away with murder when honor is the excuse. After doctors saved Saba\u2019s life \u2014 as police officers guarded the door so her father didn\u2019t return to finish the job \u2014 she was determined to prosecute her father and uncle.\u201cThey should be shot in public in an open market,\u201d she told the filmmaker, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, \u201cso that such a thing never happens again.\u201dThe police arrested Saba\u2019s father, Maqsood, and the uncle, Muhammad, and their defense was that they did the right thing.\u201cShe took away our honor,\u201d Maqsood said from his jail cell. \u201cIf you put one drop of piss in a gallon of milk, the whole thing gets destroyed. That\u2019s what she has done. \u2026 So I said, \u2018No, I will kill you myself.\u2019\u201dMaqsood said that after shooting Saba he went home and told his wife, \u201cI have gone and killed your daughter.\u201d He added: \u201cMy wife cried. What else could she do? I am her husband. She is just my wife.\u201dPerpetrators of honor killings often are not prosecuted because Pakistani law allows families of victims to forgive a killing. So a man kills his daughter, the rest of the family forgives him, and he\u2019s off the hook.Tremendous pressure was applied to Saba by community elders to pardon her father and uncle. In the end, her husband\u2019s older brother \u2014 the head of her new family \u2014 told her to forgive and move on. \u201cThere is no other way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to live in the same neighborhood.\u201dSaba complied, and her father and uncle were released from prison. \u201cAfter this incident, everyone says I am more respected,\u201d her father boasted. \u201cI can proudly say that for generations to come none of my descendants will ever think of doing what Saba did.\u201d The families still live near each other, although the father insists he will not try again to kill Saba.The way to reduce honor killings is to end the impunity. Saba tried to do her part, and let\u2019s hope Prime Minister Sharif does indeed end the legal system of forgiveness.\u201cI wanted to start a national discourse about the issue,\u201d says Obaid-Chinoy, the film\u2019s director. \u201cUntil we send people to jail and make examples of them, honor killings will continue.\u201dSince 9/11, the United States has spent billions of dollars reshaping Afghanistan and Pakistan with the military toolbox; I suspect we would have achieved more if we had relied to a greater extent on the education and women\u2019s empowerment toolboxes.A starting point would be to encourage governments to protect teenage girls from fathers who want to murder them. Chipping away at this broad pattern of gender injustice is in the interest of all of us. It is our century\u2019s great unfinished business.Advertisement"}
