Interspersed throughout clips of Harry, Liam, Louis and Niall singing against a brick wall (and Niall's new glasses!), we're flooded with black-and-white clips from their primitive \"X Factor\" days, shirtless backstage antics and, yes, some very crucial Zayn b-roll.Trigger warning: Harry Styles cuddles a giant teddy bear, and there are behind-the-scenes clips from all the major photo/video shoots in the band's career. Watch the video (and get ready to weep vigorously) below."}
