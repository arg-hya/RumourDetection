Police found more than 80,000 images and 1,750 indecent videos of children in a raid on his home in March 2015.He admitted possessing and making indecent images of children, assault of a child under 13 and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.In total Monk pleaded guilty to 18 charges at the Old Bailey.One of the girls he abused was eight years old and an image of a three-year-old child was discovered among the pictures.Judge Anuja Dhir described the pictures as \"harrowing images of very young children being abused and degraded in the most vile manner\".She said: \"Your actions were depraved and revolting. It is astonishing that anyone would want to film such abuse, but you did. \"I have no doubt you did so so that you could watch it again for your own sexual gratification.\"The growing problem of 'abuse to order'The court heard Monk paid \"facilitators\" to watch live streams of abuse and for access to the children during a two-week holiday to the Far East in the spring of 2014.The National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested Monk as part of an investigation into UK nationals who pay to live-stream child abuse in the Philippines.It was found he spent more than \u00c2\u00a314,000 to pay for what he called \"shows\" which he watched from his Erith home, before travelling to Manila to carry out the abuse himself. Analysis By BBC Correspondent Angus Crawford The case of paedophile Trevor Monk represents a growing problem of British men ordering abuse over the internet.Law enforcement is beginning to make inroads into the trade. Police in the Philippines carry out raids and arrests on a regular basis, but it's impossible to estimate accurately the scale of the problem.  Monk's case is significant because it shows that although his crimes began in the UK, using live streaming, that then led to him travelling to carry out contact abuse in the Philippines. The internet facilitated an escalation in his offending.  Most important though, is the fact that he got caught - thanks to co-operation between forces in the UK, US, Australia and the Philippines - which should send a powerful message to offenders that they cannot hide in the anonymity of the internet.He was re-arrested in November when officers discovered a video of him sexually abusing a child during a trip to South East Asia.Erica Hall, from aid charity World Vision UK, said: \"The widespread use of webcams coupled with dire economic conditions in many parts of the world means we're seeing many more cases of such vile abuse.\"It's encouraging that laws are keeping up with technology...[but] we suspect this is the tip of the iceberg with many cases still undetected.\"Following sentencing Kelvin Lay, senior investigating officer for the NCA, said it was a \"very important result\".Webcam sex abuse 'established reality'HM Courts and Tribunals ServiceLewisham daughter of UK national jailed in Iran says family \u00e2\u0080\u0098barely feels British\u00e2\u0080\u0099Firefighters save man from Clapham house blazeFamily pay tribute to London Victoria bus crash victim Melissa Burr, from RainhamSurbiton man behind fake Covid vaccine scam jailedLittle Princess Trust to get 20.5\" of autistic boy's hairLevi Roots and Matt Morrow launch Greenwich summer campInformation about BBC links to other news sitesAfghan leader addresses nation as Taliban advanceThe comments come as the Taliban close in on the capital Kabul, with fierce fighting under way.July was Earth's hottest month ever recorded\u00e2\u0080\u0098World silently watches this war against women\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Video\u00e2\u0080\u0098World silently watches this war against women\u00e2\u0080\u0099'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car'Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedomsWill Biden's biggest call yet also be his most calamitous?The female Afghan journalist who won't give up.
