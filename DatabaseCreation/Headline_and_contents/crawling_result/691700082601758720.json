Rick Perry is endorsing Ted Cruz in the Republican presidential primary, Perry told POLITICO in an interview Sunday night.Perry, who also sought the GOP nomination before dropping out in September, said he now sees the race as one that is between Cruz, a fellow Texan, and Donald Trump. Through phone calls and during a December day spent driving around his Round Top, Texas, home in his truck with Cruz, Perry said he found the senator to be a good listener who respects the Tenth Amendment, \u201cknows what he does not know\u201d and is more conservative than Trump.\u201cOf those individuals who have a chance to win the Republican primary, at this juncture, from my perspective, Ted Cruz is by far the most consistent conservative in that crowd,\u201d Perry said. \u201cAnd that appears to be down to two people.\"Perry, who is famously skilled at retail politics, will campaign with Cruz Tuesday across Iowa, and will join Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King to stump for Cruz again Wednesday. Perry and King will both join Cruz at a Des Moines rally Wednesday night. The endorsement gives Cruz the blessing of the longest-serving governor in Texas history, just as the senator faces intensifying heat from other veteran politicians, including from his colleagues in Washington, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. \nBy GLENN THRUSH and ANNIE KARNIPerry, recalling his own experience vetoing a long list of bills early in his gubernatorial tenure, said his actions resulted in others viewing him as a \u201cman of principle,\u201d and insisted that Cruz would similarly be able to get things done as president, despite his current reputation among fellow senators for being a bomb-thrower.\u201cYou\u2019ll have with Ted Cruz that same result of, senators and others in the Washington establishment that are mad at him, find him to be hard to work with, they will find a way to work with him because they know he means what he says he means,\u201d he said.Perry has been dismissive in the past of the experience of first-term senators compared to governors. But he said Sunday that he has come to realize the GOP electorate doesn\u2019t value executive experience this cycle in the same way he does.\u201cGov. Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, Rick Perry, Jeb\u2019s barely making an impact out there \u2014 those are very skilled, very successful, very experienced governors,\u201d Perry said. \u201cBut the electorate doesn\u2019t want that. That\u2019s why we have elections, why we democratically select leaders.\u201dAnd he is confident, he said, that Cruz would be prepared.\u201cHe knows he\u2019s going to surround himself with people who do have that experience, and I\u2019m very satisfied that on Day 1, he will be ready to be commander-in-chief,\u201d Perry said, \u201cPartly because of the time he\u2019s going to spend in learning what he doesn\u2019t know, but he\u2019s also surrounding himself with people who are extraordinarily capable and wise.\u201dPerry\u2019s endorsement was hardly a sure bet. The two were on opposite sides of the 2012 Senate primary race, when Cruz ran successfully against Perry\u2019s then-lieutenant governor, David Dewhurst, in a contest that launched Cruz on the national stage. In his farewell address before the Republican-dominated state legislature last year, Perry warned against those who would place \u201cpurity ahead of unity\u201d \u2014 a frequent criticism of Cruz's style. And Perry was somewhat critical of Cruz\u2019s role in shutting down the government in 2013 over a health care battle.\u201cI\u2019d rather see folks come together, work together to find solutions, but from time to time, you\u2019ve got to lay the marker down,\u201d Perry said, when asked whether Cruz could work with Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s that old adage, \u2018You gotta hit the mule upside the head to get its attention from time to time.\u2019 I\u2019d suggest that\u2019s exactly what the senator was doing.\u201dPerry, an Air Force veteran and champion of veterans\u2019 issues, is expected to be particularly helpful in courting veterans, especially in South Carolina, which is home to prominent military bases and an electorate with a strongly pro-military bent \u2014 and where Perry had a well-respected team. Shortly before he exited the race in the fall, Perry had emerged as one of the field\u2019s most pointed critics of Trump, a mantle Cruz now holds as he and Trump battle for first place in Iowa. The former Texas governor noted that a number of other prominent conservatives, including media personality Glenn Beck, have come out against Donald Trump, something Trump\u2019s \u201cgoing to have to explain.\u201d\nBy SHANE GOLDMACHERAfter Perry dropped out of the primary, Cruz's campaign immediately began courting his donors and supporters in Texas, while Cruz reached out to the former governor and asked to get together -- a gesture Perry says he appreciated given how little down time candidates get off the trail. When they met, Perry said, Cruz struck him as someone who deep down is likely \u201cshy,\u201d and \u201cone of the best listeners I\u2019ve ever dealt with in the political realm.\u201d It was in stark contrast to more negative perceptions he had held about Cruz, driven by \"media narrative\" and \"through the optics of a campaign.\"\u201cI really didn\u2019t want to talk about policy, I didn\u2019t want to talk politics, I didn\u2019t want to talk philosophy,\u201d he said of their meeting last month. \u201cI wanted to talk about him, who he was, see if I could get a handle on Ted Cruz the man, not Cruz the caricature I\u2019d seen through the political lens. What I found was a very different person than what I had been led to believe.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
