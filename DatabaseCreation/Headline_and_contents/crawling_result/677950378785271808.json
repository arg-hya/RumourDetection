Steven Universe is back January 4th, with a whole week of episodes!Last night, Steven Universe returned for what is purportedly the final time before another hiatus\u2026The event is ostensibly to celebrate Steven\u2019s Birthday, but really, it means we\u2019re getting five episodes, one a day, between January 4th and January 8th\u2014commonly called a \u201cSteven Bomb\u201d by Cartoon Network, who announced the show\u2019s return with a press release today. Here\u2019s a rundown of the new episodes, as well as a new picture from the first episode in the line up, \u201cThe Answer\u201d:\u201cThe Answer\u201d\u2013 Garnet finally tells Steven the story of how she came to be a Crystal Gem.\u201cSteven\u2019s Birthday\u201d \u2013 Steven has a birthday party out at the barn, and decides he has some growing up to do.\u201cIt Could\u2019ve Been Great\u201d \u2013 The Gems take a trip to the moon.\u201cMessage Received\u201d \u2013 Steven has doubts about believing in everyone.\u201cLog Date 7 15 2\u201d\u2013 Steven sneaks a listen to a friend\u2019s audio diary.As the resident Steven Universe fan here on io9, I\u2019m just gonna go and run around in circles wooping for the next five minutes.
