But she was shocked when she visited him at lunch that day and learned what his detention was actually like.\u201cHe was at the first table as you walk into the cafeteria, and he was just sitting there with one of those cardboard poster partitions in front of him ... and two or three books next to him,\u201d Garloff said.She said the school policy was to have students make up work they missed because they were late. Since Hunter was only late by a few minutes, he didn\u2019t have work to make up, so he was told to read a book.\u201cI was really upset. I went and got my iPad and took a picture of him,\u201d said Garloff. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t tardy so many times that he deserved that.After Garloff posted the photo on her Facebook, the image of her son sitting alone at lunch went viral, coming to the attention of AM 1440 radio personality Bill Meyer. Meyer first heard about the story through his listeners and social media.\u201cWe see a lot of bad news, or we have a lot of problems. So seldomly do we ever get a chance to fix the root of the problem,\u201d Meyer told ABC News. \u201cI saw the school policy as being unjust, but I saw the root of the trouble was car trouble.\u201dSo Meyer reached out to Lisa McClease-Kelly, who owns Kelly\u2019s Automotive, which is located in Medford and in Grants Pass, to see if she would be willing to repair the family\u2019s Dodge Durango.\u201cThe repairs were more than what the car was actually worth,\u201d McClease-Kelly told ABC News. Luckily, a local company, Rapid Repo and Collections, offered to donate a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country van to the family.Other local businesses pitched in to install a new windshield in the van, two new tires, and McClease-Kelly put about $1,400 of maintenance into it. Hunter\u2019s family was surprised when they came to the shop this week.\u201cWe thought we were going there to be told that our Durango was not going to be fixable at all,\u201d Garloff said. \u201cWe were so shocked, it doesn\u2019t seem real. I\u2019m trying to tell Hunter that this doesn\u2019t just happen to you.\u201dMcClease-Kelly will give the family free oil changes for a year, and many others who heard their story donated to give the family a gas card, as well as gift cards to local restaurants.\u201cThis family never asked for the help. All they ever wanted was to change the school policy,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cWe saw a way to do a little nudge, and then everyone else came in with their time and generosity.\u201dThe school policy has since been amended, according to the Grants Pass District Superintendent\u2019s office.\u201cAs a result of the concerns raised, the district ended the learning catch-up location at Lincoln Elementary School,\u201d the Grants Pass District said in a statement. \u201cGoing forward, a separate, supervised classroom has been designated for necessary catch-up work.\u201dGarloff said Hunter hasn\u2019t been late since the family got the van and that she is waiting to see if the school\u2019s policy will change.\u201cWe\u2019re so thankful to all the people in our community that have just been so supportive,\u201d Garloff said.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}
