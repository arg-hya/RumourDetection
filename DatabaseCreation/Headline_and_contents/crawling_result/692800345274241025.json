And man, it was a doozy.As we previously reported, the 23-year-old revealed in the lengthy interview that his debut solo album is titled Mind Of Mine and will feature 17 or 18 songs. The first single, \u201cPillowtalk,\u201d arrives tonight at midnight EST. While we wait for that first taste of Solo Zayn, let\u2019s take a look at 13 of the most shocking, revelatory and exciting things he talked about in the no-holds-barred interview:Zayn said there\u2019s a song called \u201cWrong\u201d that\u2019s \u201call about looking in the wrong place for love.\u201d He says he originally wrote as a rap, which he then used to create lyrics for the song. He played it for Kehlani, and the two then decided to trade features with one another \u2014 so it sounds like he may be appearing on one of Kehlani\u2019s upcoming songs as well. Zayn said there\u2019s \u201ca fine line\u201d when tackling that kind of personal subject matter, but ultimately, it was a cathartic process for him. \u201cIt was a form of therapy for me, and it did help me get through some sh-t,\u201d he said about writing the song.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit more of like a party tune. And it\u2019s a bit more\u2026 it\u2019s not as intense lyrically. It\u2019s more about just having a good time,\u201d he said, assuring Lowe that he is, in fact, enjoying himself these days.\u201cHe\u2019s just an amazing person. Like from the second I met him I just knew he was kind of different,\u201d Zayn said. \u201cHe looks into every instrument in high detail and he understands how to break it down.\u201d Zayn said Malay once told him a story of how he crafted a beat by putting a condom over a microphone and swishing it around in water. So who knows what kind of crazy sounds we\u2019ll hear on Zayn\u2019s LP.\u201cI\u2019ve got a video for \u2018Pillowtalk.\u2019 I haven\u2019t got videos for any other songs yet,\u201d he dished, adding that the video will definitely be true to his vision. \u201cIn terms of collaborating, it\u2019s all my creative direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s massively liberating, do you know what I mean? It feels great to be able to just be like, \u2018Yeah I did that.\u2019\u201dAfter Lowe brought up that Zayn is \u201cin a relationship,\u201d the singer didn\u2019t exactly agree. \u201cYeah, good friends, yeah,\u201d Zayn said. Hmmmm, either there\u2019s trouble in #Zaygi land or he\u2019s just keeping tight-lipped and isn\u2019t ready to take their coupledom public. No harm in either.\u201cEventually, yeah. If there\u2019s a demand for it, I\u2019ll tour,\u201d he said, adding that he wants to see what the response to his music is like first. He did, however, reveal that he\u2019s already rehearsing some of the songs from his album with a live band, including two lead female guitarists who are \u201creally sick.\u201d So it sounds like he may have some live performances coming up in the near future, likely to promote \u201cPillowtalk.\u201dZayn recounted the story of how his mom made him get up and go to his \u201cX Factor\u201d audition when all he wanted to do was sleep in. That anecdote basically mirrored Z\u2019s experience on the show \u2014 he told Lowe that he was \u201calways going to rebel against the system,\u201d saying he was \u201cmassively nervous\u201d to dance in front of people on television. \u201cThe whole dancing thing just wasn\u2019t a thing I was interested in. [\u2026] You go on that show with your own preconceptions, and they\u2019re just going to show you what they want and do whatever they want you to do.\u201d He says he went along with all of it, but he didn\u2019t enjoy it.\u201cI think I kind of always wanted to go. From like from the first year, really,\u201d Zayn admitted. \u201cI never really wanted to be there, in the band. I just gave it a go because it was there at the time. And then when I realized the direction we were going in, mind the pun, I instantly realized it wasn\u2019t for me because I realized I couldn\u2019t give my opinion because it didn\u2019t fit the grain of what we were at the band and what we represented. That\u2019s when it became frustrating.\u201dHe said that in the early days, it would often be the five of them in a room trying to write a song, and he didn\u2019t feel like his voice could be heard that way. \u201cNow how do you write a song from five people\u2019s perspectives?\u201d he asked, explaining that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be the person to say that I was right.\u201d Now, Zayn said he prefers to write songs completely alone because it allows him to say things he \u201cwouldn\u2019t normally say.\u201d\u201cI think the boys kind of knew that, in terms of the music, that wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. They were aware of that,\u201d Zayn said. So it when it came time for him to tell the group he was leaving, they didn\u2019t try to persuade him otherwise. \u201cThey obviously didn\u2019t want me to leave, but they couldn't talk me out of it at that point,\u201d he said. \u201cI had made my mind up.\u201dZayn said that after leaving 1D\u2019s tour, he got on a plane and flew straight home. \u201cMy dad weren\u2019t too impressed,\u201d he said, explaining that his dad initially saw him as a quitter (Papa Malik\u2019s since come around though). His mom, however, got straight to work cooking for him and taking care of him, which Zayn says relieved his stress immensely. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman that you always need,\u201d he said about his mum. After a couple months of laying low, though, Z say he \u201cgot itchy feet\u201d and got to work in the studio, prepping his solo debut.\u201cThat was amazing. I did that for five years and we had some of the best times ever,\u201d he said of his time with the band, before explaining that what he\u2019s doing now is more true to who he is. \u201cThe two things are very separate. I appreciated that, they\u2019re just two completely separate things. This is more fun for me [\u2026] This is what I have to say.\u201d As for what he wants to get across with his solo music, Zayn says it\u2019s all about showing off his vocal talent, his ability to write and talk from his own perspective and proving \u201cI can hold my own.\u201d"}
