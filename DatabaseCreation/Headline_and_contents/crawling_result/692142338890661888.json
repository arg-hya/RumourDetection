Is Found in an Ex-Giant Tyler Sash, Who Died at 27", "content": "AdvertisementSupported byBy Bill PenningtonWhen the former Giants safety Tyler Sash was found dead at age 27 of an accidental overdose of pain medications at his Iowa home on Sept. 8, his grieving family remained consumed by a host of unanswered questions about the final, perplexing years of Sash\u2019s life.Cut by the Giants in 2013 after what was at least his fifth concussion, Sash had returned to Iowa and increasingly displayed surprising and irregular behavior, family members said this week. He was arrested in his hometown, Oskaloosa, for public intoxication after leading the police on a four-block chase with a motorized scooter, a pursuit that ended with Sash fleeing toward a wooded area.Sash had bouts of confusion, memory loss and minor fits of temper. Although an Iowa sports celebrity, both as a Super Bowl-winning member of the Giants and a popular star athlete at the University of Iowa, Sash was unable to seek meaningful employment because he had difficulty focusing long enough to finish a job.Barnetta Sash, Tyler\u2019s mother, blamed much of her son\u2019s changeable behavior, which she had not observed in the past, on the powerful prescription drugs he was taking for a football-related shoulder injury that needed surgery. Nonetheless, after his death she donated his brain to be tested for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated trauma that has been found in dozens of former N.F.L. players.Last week, representatives from Boston University and the Concussion Legacy Foundation notified the Sash family that C.T.E. had been diagnosed in Tyler\u2019s brain and that the disease, which can be confirmed only posthumously, had advanced to a stage rarely seen in someone his age.Dr. Ann McKee, chief of neuropathology at the V.A. Boston Healthcare System and a professor of neurology and pathology at the Boston University School of Medicine who conducted the examination, said Tuesday that the severity of the C.T.E. in Sash\u2019s brain was about the same as the level found in the brain of the former N.F.L. star Junior Seau, who committed suicide in 2012 at age 43.Doctors grade C.T.E. on a severity scale from 0 to 4; Sash was at Stage 2. McKee, comparing the results to other athletes who died at a similar age, said she had seen only one case, that of a 25-year-old former college player, with a similar amount of the disease.The Sash family, who released the findings, said the outcome brought some clarity to the end of Tyler Sash\u2019s life.\u201cMy son knew something was wrong, but he couldn\u2019t express it,\u201d Barnetta Sash said Monday night. \u201cHe was such a good person, and it\u2019s sad that he struggled so with this \u2014 not knowing where to go with it.\u201dShe continued: \u201cNow it makes sense. The part of the brain that controls impulses, decision-making and reasoning was damaged badly.\u201dMcKee said that \u201cvery classic lesions of C.T.E.\u201d were found in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and in the amygdala. The location of lesions has bearing on symptoms exhibited.\u201cIt helps explain his inattention, his short fuse and his lack of focus,\u201d McKee said.McKee added: \u201cEven though he was only 27, he played 16 years of football, and we\u2019re finding over and over that it\u2019s the duration of exposure to football that gives you a high risk for C.T.E. Certainly, 16 years is a high exposure.\u201dAn autopsy revealed that the cause of Sash\u2019s death was a lethal mixture of two powerful pain medications, methadone and hydrocodone. A medical examiner called the overdose \u201caccidental drug toxicity,\u201d adding that a recent shoulder dislocation and a history of chronic shoulder pain were \u201csignificant conditions\u201d in the death.Sash, a sixth-round draft pick of the Giants, was primarily a reserve for the team during two seasons, most notably during the team\u2019s 2011 season, which ended with a Super Bowl victory. He played a total of 23 games plus four postseason games and was cut by the Giants weeks before the opener of the 2013 season, reaching an injury settlement after he sustained a concussion in the final game of the preseason.In 2012, Sash was suspended for four games for violating the N.F.L.\u2019s policy on performance-enhancing substances by testing positive for Adderall, a stimulant used primarily to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Sash said at the time that he had used the drug legally under a doctor\u2019s orders to combat anxiety before a public speaking engagement but did not know it was on the league\u2019s banned list.At Iowa, Sash started 37 games from 2007 to 2010, earning first-team All-Big Ten honors in his final season.Sash came from a football family. His father, Michael, played in college and his brother, Josh, was a good enough high school player that he considered playing in college as well.Josh Sash, eight years older than Tyler, said his brother sustained at least two concussions in high school, one documented concussion in college and two with the Giants, including one in the Giants\u2019 playoff victory over the San Francisco 49ers that earned the team its berth in the Super Bowl after the 2011 season.In the San Francisco game, Sash, who was 215 pounds, was blindsided by a brutal and borderline late hit on a punt return by a 281-pound defensive lineman.\u201cThose concussions are the ones we definitely know about,\u201d Josh Sash said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve played football, you know there are often other incidents.\u201dExperts believe that less severe blows to the head \u2014 those not strong enough to cause a concussion \u2014 also significantly contribute to the damage that results in C.T.E. These lesser traumas are especially troubling, neurologists say, because they happen frequently in contact sports like football but go undiagnosed.Josh Sash, who has two young sons, said it would be difficult for him to recommend that his children play football when they grow older. Barnetta Sash, who said she had always loved football, felt similarly.\u201cI want other parents to realize they need to have a conversation with their kids and not just think it\u2019s a harmless game \u2014 because it\u2019s not,\u201d said Barnetta Sash, whose daughter, Megan, has three children.The N.F.L. has agreed to a court settlement with former players that would compensate them for severe neurological conditions. The settlement is being appealed. Sash\u2019s family would not be eligible for a payment because only the families of players who died and were found to have had C.T.E. before the settlement was approved in April 2015 may receive compensation.When Tyler Sash returned to Iowa after the Giants released him in 2013, Barnetta Sash said he hid his shoulder injury for some time because he still hoped to sign with another N.F.L. team. Both shoulders had been operated on in college.\u201cHis shoulders were an ongoing problem; he couldn\u2019t sleep on either shoulder,\u201d said Barnetta, who said her son sometimes would go two days without sleeping because of the discomfort.Tyler received a doctor\u2019s prescription for hydrocodone and awaited doctors\u2019 evaluations about surgery that could repair the shoulder. He worked at jobs doing menial labor but his shoulder was a constant problem, dislocating once as Sash took off his shirt.In time, the Sash family noticed Tyler\u2019s forgetfulness \u2014 he would sometimes repeat himself several times in a conversation. The family told Boston University doctors that Sash had headaches, lost his wallet several times and had trouble doing other routine tasks like composing or reading emails.\u201cHe didn\u2019t quite seem to be the same person he used to be,\u201d Josh Sash said.Barnetta Sash said Tyler had multiple offers for better-paying or higher-profile jobs.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t focus long enough to do a job,\u201d Barnetta said.Tyler talked to various people in his circle of friends and family about stories he had read of mental acuity issues, and C.T.E., in former football players.\u201cHe would make comments periodically,\u201d Barnetta said. \u201cHe would joke, \u2018I\u2019ll be sitting in a nursing home with dementia.\u2019 \u201dBut Barnetta mainly worried about the pain medications Tyler was taking and felt they were the source of his problems. \u201cWe thought the surgery he was going to have would take care of things so he didn\u2019t have to take the medication and we would have our son back,\u201d she said.Two days before he was found dead, a Sunday, Tyler was at his parents\u2019 house and spent much of the day playing with his nieces and nephews. But he had recently fallen off a ladder and dislocated his shoulder again. His mother and sister popped it back in.\u201cIt must have cracked and snapped 10 times, 20 times,\u201d said Barnetta, adding that Tyler appeared exhausted, which she surmised was from a lack of sleep.Tyler left his parents\u2019 house Sunday around 9 p.m., making his way to his home in another part of Oskaloosa.\u201cWhat I suspect is that he found some methadone from somewhere and he took it to relieve his pain but there are probably special instructions that go with that,\u201d Barnetta said.The next day, Labor Day, Barnetta went to Tyler\u2019s house, as she often did, to walk his dog.\u201cI saw him sleeping on the couch,\u201d she said of Tyler. \u201cI was so happy because he had seemed so tired and stressed out.\u201dShe walked the dog, brought it back to the house and quietly closed the door. She returned the next morning, Sept. 8.\u201cThat\u2019s when I found him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think he died Sunday night. He was gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
