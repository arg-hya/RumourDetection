So earlier this week, we reiterated with our team members where Target stands and how our beliefs are brought to life in how we serve our guests.Inclusivity is a core belief at Target. It\u2019s something we celebrate. We stand for equality and equity, and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day.We believe that everyone\u2014every team member, every guest, and every community\u2014deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally. Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination.In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways. Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.Bathroom\u00a0controversies weren\u2019t new in April 2016, but HB2, which was by far the highest profile\u00a0legislation of that nature,\u00a0provoked a huge response across the country.\u00a0\u00a0Target was not the\u00a0first large and well-known entity to clarify its policy about\u00a0transgender bathroom use, and the brand responded to some feedback on Twitter:@Kusau Everyone is welcome at Target. \u2014 Target (@Target) April 20, 2016Not all of the public\u2019s response was positive. Target\u2019s Facebook page was flooded with critical responses similar to the \u00a0(heavily\u00a0satirized) comments\u00a0that appeared when the chain announced gender-neutral toy aisles:Some misinformation also circulated about the development. The web site The Political Insider reported\u00a0that the retailer released the statement under pressure from the President and LGBT groups:Target just caved to pressure from the Obama administration and liberal activists. They have announced that any \u201ctransgendered\u201d person can use the bathroom in their stores, according to the gender they associate with.Now in Target stores, men are allowed to use the restroom next to your daughter. Once called perverted, this is now a \u201ccivil right.\u201dNo information we could find substantiated the claim that Target was pressured to institute the chain-wide policy, and no retailers of a similar size and scope have reported any organized push\u00a0to enact similar policies.\u00a0While HB2 is\u00a0an enforceable law, Target\u2019s bathroom policy is\u00a0simply a brand\u2019s policy decision based on its own ethics and\u00a0belief structure.It is\u00a0true that Target announced on 19 April 2016 that transgender shoppers and staffers were\u00a0welcome to use the bathroom that best matched\u00a0their gender identities. However, neither President Obama nor any groups appeared to have forced the retailer\u2019s hand in issuing the policy, and no \u201ctransgender bathrooms\u201d were included in the details of the announcement.CompanyNavigateSectionsAccount\u00a9 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc.This material may not be reproduced without permission.Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"}
