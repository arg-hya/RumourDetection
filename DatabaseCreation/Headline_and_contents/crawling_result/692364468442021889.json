Case in point: The 18-year-old had a solo jam session on Monday (Jan. 25), during which she recorded herself singing and strumming along to Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cLove Yourself.\u201dAfter nailing the original song\u2019s mellow chorus, Camila decided to completely revamp the bridge by adding in her own lyrics: \u201cYou tried to make me insecure/ You tried to break me, maybe \u2018cause you couldn\u2019t love yourself.\u201dFor the third and final clip, she continued her own addition to the song, singing, \u201cBut your poison was the cure/ And by accident you showed me how to love myself.\u201dCamila wrote in each clip\u2019s caption that she was just \u201cplayin around,\u201d but I think we can all agree her casual jam should be turned into a proper, full-length cover. Or maybe even a duet with JB himself? Just sayin', guy-girl duets are totally having a moment lately, between Charlie Puth and Selena Gomez's \"We Don't Talk Anymore,\" and Ariana Grande and Nathan Sykes' \"Over and Over Again.\" Make it happen, guys!"}
