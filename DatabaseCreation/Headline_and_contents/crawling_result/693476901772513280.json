{"id": "693476901772513280", "headline": "Migrant crisis: Dozens drown off Turkey as boat capsizes", "content": "At least 39 migrants, including several children, have drowned trying to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, coastguards say.More than 60 have been rescued from the sea near the Turkish resort of Ayvacik.Local officials say they expect the death toll to rise when the capsized boat is searched.Thousands of refugees and migrants continue to make the dangerous sea journey from Turkey to Greece to seek asylum in northern Europe.The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Friday that 244 migrants had drowned in the Mediterranean so far this year, out of 55,568 arrivals. \"The daily average (of arrivals) is nearly equivalent to the total numbers for the month of January as recently as two years ago,\" the IOM said.The latest tragedy comes just days after 26 migrants drowned when their boat sank off the coast of the Greek island of Samos.Katya Adler: Germans struggle to cope with influxTeaching migrants how to behaveMigrants feel chill of tighter bordersEurope's migrant crisisThe Turkish coastguard said that in Saturday's incident the migrants had been trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos when their boat capsized.Lesbos is one of the most popular European arrival points for asylum seekers.The deputy governor of Turkey's Canakkale province, Saim Eskioglu, said the 17m (56ft) boat \"hit rocks soon after it left the coast\".\"We believe there are more dead bodies inside the boat,'' he told CNN-Turk TV.Many of those rescued are being treated in hospital for hypothermia.A Turkish man suspected of being the people smuggler who organised the trip has been arrested, according to Turkey's Dogan news agency.However, the BBC's Mark Lowen in Turkey says those caught are typically middle-men rather than the main criminals behind the people smuggling.Those on board were from Afghanistan, Syria and Myanmar, Turkey's Anadolu news agency said.Last year more than one million migrants, many fleeing war, poverty and oppression, arrived in Europe, causing a political crisis among EU states.The mass movement of refugees is largely fuelled by the war in Syria and talks have opened in Geneva to try to find a solution to the violence.Last week, a draft European Commission report said Greece had \"seriously neglected\" its obligations to control the external frontier of Europe's passport-free Schengen zone. The Greek government accused the commission of playing \"blame games\".Late last year, the Turkish government signed a deal with the EU to receive about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac3bn (\u00c2\u00a32.2bn; $3.3bn) in return for stemming the flow of asylum seekers. But the proposals have reportedly stalled amid objections from Italy.Turkey is home to nearly three million refugees, most of them from Syria.Many of them pay smugglers thousands of dollars to make the crossing to Greece. They then head north, with most trying to reach Germany, Austria and Scandinavia.A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.Afghan leader addresses nation as Taliban advanceThe comments come as the Taliban close in on the capital Kabul, with fierce fighting under way.July was Earth's hottest month ever recorded\u00e2\u0080\u0098World silently watches this war against women\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Video\u00e2\u0080\u0098World silently watches this war against women\u00e2\u0080\u0099'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car'Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedomsWill Biden's biggest call yet also be his most calamitous?The female Afghan journalist who won't give up.
