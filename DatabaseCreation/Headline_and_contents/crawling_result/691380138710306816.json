If you\u2019d told me back then we\u2019d still be pounding some of those very same targets today, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you.\u201d\u201cBut hundreds of thousands of bombs later, here we are!\u201d Cheney added to thunderous applause. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all thanks to the dedication and resolve of the people in this room.\u201dLeading the gala\u2019s impressive guest list were Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, who according to reports spent much of the evening exchanging stories\u2014some old, some new\u2014of their respective experiences demolishing Fallujah, Mosul, Anbar Province, the Sunni Triangle, and countless other locations. The former commanders-in-chief reportedly shared the head table with a delegation from the neoconservative think tank Project for the New American Century and members of the Saudi royal family, whom Cheney praised as \u201cstaunch allies through this whole thing.\u201dAlso present were Iraq War architects Condoleezza Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, Doug Feith, and Richard Perle, who admitted to reporters they felt overwhelmed by nostalgia throughout the event as they reconnected with old faces and shared laughs over the discredited intelligence that served as the basis for military action. Reportedly seated nearby were journalists Judith Miller and Bill Keller, who received a special commendation for their work covering the run-up to the 2003 invasion for The New York Times, drawing one of the largest standing ovations of the night.Representatives from Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrup Grumman, and other weapons manufacturers were honored as well, and thanked for donating the gala\u2019s elaborate ice sculptures that depicted a vintage Raytheon-designed Patriot missile from Operation Desert Storm, a 2003-era cluster bomb now banned by most countries, and a modern MQ-9 Reaper UAV armed with Hellfire missiles and 500-pound munitions.\u201cThis is a truly magnificent night\u2014I just wish Gen. [Norman] Schwarzkopf were here to see it,\u201d said retired Gen. Raymond T. Odierno during a portion of the evening\u2019s ceremonies that paid tribute to all the commanders of U.S. forces in Iraq over the years. \u201cTwenty-five years ago, I was only a major, still in my 30s, and I really looked up to that guy. I never thought I\u2019d get a chance to do what he did, but a couple decades later, there I was, ordering some of the very same bombing runs that he had. I modeled my entire career after his and feel privileged to have followed so closely in his footsteps.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s especially important that we take a moment tonight to honor our legacy in Iraq so that today\u2019s troops can fully appreciate the rich history of our military campaigns there,\u201d continued Odierno, \u201cas most of them weren\u2019t born yet when we started bombing the place.\u201dAccording to attendees, the gala featured an elaborate multimedia presentation titled A Generation Of Commitment, which began with a montage of night-vision targeting footage from Desert Storm interspersed with reports from up-and-coming CNN correspondent Wolf Blitzer. A segment called \u201cThe Clinton Years: A Retrospective\u201d showed F-16 fighter jets enforcing no-fly zones, and then rolled highlights from Operation Desert Fox while Outkast\u2019s 2000 recording \u201cB.O.B (Bombs Over Baghdad)\u201d played in the background.The presentation\u2019s survey of Operation Iraqi Freedom included video of then\u2013Secretary of State Colin Powell assuring the U.N. that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, a May 2003 clip of a flight suit\u2013clad George W. Bush landing on an aircraft carrier adorned with a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner, and a July 2003 clip of Bush saying \u201cBring \u2019em on\u201d in response to questions about the rapidly growing Iraqi insurgency.The final segment, \u201cDrones: The Game-Changer,\u201d showed images taken just last week of airmen in a small computer room in Nevada bombing Iraq using joysticks and real-time video feeds.\u201cSure, we\u2019ve been through some hard times, especially those dark days in 2012 and 2013 when we pretty much stopped bombing Iraq entirely,\u201d former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in his closing remarks to the group, raising a glass of champagne as the room followed suit. \u201cBut we started right up again, like we always do, and we\u2019ve seen thousands of new airstrikes since. Our enemy may change, but from Saddam to the Islamic State\u2014and through all the I-don\u2019t-know-how-many insurgencies in between\u2014our mission has remained the same. We\u2019ve stayed true to our roots and kept the tradition of bombing Iraq alive.\u201dAdded Rumsfeld, \u201cHere\u2019s to 25 more years!\u201d"}
