It's a wonderful thing.\"But if I'm being very honest, you don't do it for those reasons. You really do it to make a great piece of art that some day you can look back on.\"He added: \"It's always this strange experience when people start talking about awards because it's something that's beyond your control.

Andrew's been developing this project himself for over 6 years. Sometimes you just have to take your time with these things. It's a different kind of film to almost anything else that comes out of the Hollywood system. It's arresting, disturbing, explosive... but all in a very quiet, subtle way. The ending is nothing like anything you normally find in a big budget drama: ambiguous, haunting, it makes you revise your entire opinion of the film the moment the credits start to roll.

He was the finest of actors and directors. I couldn\u2019t wait to see what he was going to do with his face next.

He is also, one of the loyalest and most supportive people I've ever met in the film industry. He was so encouraging of me both on set and in the years post-Potter. I'm pretty sure he came and saw everything I ever did on stage both in London and New York. He didn't have to do that.

I recalled the trailer in which he offered me some of the greatest advice I ever received about this mad profession we shared.
