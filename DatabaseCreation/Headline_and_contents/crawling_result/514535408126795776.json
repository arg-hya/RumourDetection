But by far the coolest feature of a phone people pooped in bags while waiting in line for is that if you sit with it in your pocket, it bends beyond\u00a0repair.Macrumors reports that several iPhone 6 Plus users have found that their phones became bent after they sat or bent over with the phones in their pockets. This, of course, is totally understandable, since thinner phones are just more malleable (it\u2019s\u00a0physics).If you do not wish to take advantage of this cool new feature, Macrumors says users \u201cmay want to remove their iPhones from their pockets before sitting or\u00a0bending.\u201dPerhaps someday we will have the technology to create pocketable phones.\u00a0Someday.A ringing endorsement"}
