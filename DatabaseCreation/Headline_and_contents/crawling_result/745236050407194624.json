I believe that's the San Andreas Fault pic.twitter.com/IdSv3Zbib3Vancouver can get an #earthquake too, but Cali has the San Andreas Fault. Look at that red line! #crashCoursepic.twitter.com/IdyEFHZ35vThe San Andreas Fault is the tectonic boundary between the Pacific and North American Plates and runs close to major cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco as well as nuclear power plantsREAD MORE:\u00a0Disasters waiting to happen: 8 most dangerous nuclear plants near earthquake fault lines\u2018The Big One\u2019 is expected to produce a game-changing earthquake within the next 30 years causing massive devastation to California.Federal, state, and military officials have been working on contingency plans for the looming disaster, which could see 14,000 dead and 30,000 injured, according to AP. \u00a0Catastrophic California quake due at any time, warns seismologist https://t.co/RZbLjfIUZlpic.twitter.com/IQW99lS7wyCalifornia\u2019s \u2018Big One\u2019 could trigger super cycle of destructive quakes \u2013 leading seismologist http://t.co/HS1zABiKuWpic.twitter.com/Hg4YHEko1NA 2005 study published in the journal Nature found the fault had reached a sufficient level of stress for an earthquake of a magnitude greater than 7.0, with the risk concentrated on the area of the fault near Los Angeles.According to the new research, scientists will be able to study and understand the behavior of faults, even when dormant, using the vertical readings in the hope of predicting activity.Emergency services will also benefit from more accurate seismic hazard estimates, predicting where on the surface movement is more likely to occur when \u2018The Big One\u2019 eventually strikes.San Francisco\u2019s 1906 earthquake of magnitude 7.8 left more than half of the city\u2019s residents homeless and killed between 700 and 3,000 people.The view down Sacramento Street in San Francisco, California #after the #great#earthquake of 1906 pic.twitter.com/5LhJLeMahRChilling photos of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake set it ablaze\u2026 https://t.co/pf8whgGmrqpic.twitter.com/TqUBmkZXqbRT News App\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132021.
