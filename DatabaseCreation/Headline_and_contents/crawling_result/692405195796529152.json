Tom Symonds, BBC home affairs correspondentBellfield wasn't arrested and charged until detectives connected him with two other horrific murders - those of Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange and the attempted murder of a young woman called Kate Sheedy.But this admission today makes little difference. Despite admitting what he's done, he is serving what is called a whole life tariff - so he will never be released.Milly's body was later found 25 miles away in Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Experts could not say how she died. Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and murdering the teenager following a trial at the Old Bailey where a judge described him as a \"cruel and pitiless killer\".He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly.Bellfield, who now calls himself Yusuf Rahim, lived 50 yards from where Milly vanished but did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004.Milly family's wait for justiceBellfield guilty of Milly murderProfiles of Bellfield's victimsSurrey PoliceDiplomats hasten exit as Taliban near KabulUS troops arrive to help with evacuation efforts as militants seize a city an hour's drive from Kabul.July was Earth's hottest month ever - US agencyBBC condemns expulsion of journalist from Russia'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car'Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedomsWill Biden's biggest call yet also be his most calamitous?The female Afghan journalist who won't give up.
