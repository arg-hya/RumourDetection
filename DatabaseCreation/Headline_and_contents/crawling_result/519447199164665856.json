ArchiboldIGUALA, Mexico \u2014 They were farm boys who did well in school and took one of the few options available beyond the backbreaking work in the corn and bean fields of southern Mexico: enrolling in a local teachers college with a history of radicalism but the promise of a stable classroom job.Leonel Castro, 19, the oldest of seven siblings, vowed to use his salary to help his impoverished family. J\u00falio C\u00e9sar, 19, thought he could run a school one day and ensure the best for the next generation. Ad\u00e1n Abraham de la Cruz, 23, wanted to put his computer skills to good use in the classroom.\u201cHe was just preparing himself to get ahead like any young person would do,\u201d said Mr. de la Cruz\u2019s father, Bernab\u00e9.Now, they are among 43 students reported missing after deadly clashes with the police on Sept. 26, when at least six student protesters and bystanders were killed in the restive, rural state of Guerrero, one of the poorest in the country and long afflicted by political, social and criminal upheaval.The state prosecutor investigating why the police opened fire on students from their vehicles has found mass graves in Iguala \u2014 the small industrial city where the confrontations occurred \u2014 containing 28 badly burned and dismembered bodies.The prosecutors had already arrested 22 police officers after the clashes, saying the officers secretly worked for, or were members of, a local gang. Now they are investigating whether the police apprehended the students after the confrontation and deliberately turned them over to the local gang. Two witnesses in custody told prosecutors that the gang then killed the protesters on the orders of a leader known as El Chucky.\u201cI saw police trucks go up and down the hill to up there, where the bodies are found,\u201d said one man in the neighborhood near the site who declined to give his name out of fear. \u201cThen came the news they found the grave and it may be the students. But you would be a fool around here to accuse the police and expect to live.\u201dEven in a country accustomed to mass killings, the case has generated alarm, both for the possible involvement of the police and for the fact that the students were not known to have criminal ties. Miguel Mart\u00ednez, a representative for the families, said students at the school had fought back against extortion attempts by gangs last year, but it was not clear if that could have made them a target now.The students, by many accounts, had been soliciting money in Iguala for an Oct. 2 demonstration rejecting cuts to their state-financed school, which opened in 1926 and has long played a role in local social justice movements. Such student demonstrations are part of a well-known militancy that goes back decades and has provoked violence in the past. It did again this time, as students got into a skirmish with the police when they tried to steal buses to take to and from the demonstration, human rights groups said.The mayor and the police chief of Iguala are now on the run, having disappeared after being subpoenaed in the case, and the governor of the state confirmed that the local gang, known as Guerreros Unidos, had infiltrated the police force in Iguala, as well as other police departments in the state.The specter of corrupted police has haunted Mexico for years. But these disappearances come at a time when President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is already confronting the prosecution of at least three soldiers charged with homicide in another recent case \u2014 the shooting death of 22 people captured in a warehouse in June.\u201cI feel deeply outraged and dismayed,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto told reporters Monday, referring to the violence here and dispatching the attorney general and other federal forces to the region. \u201cI regret, in particular, the violence that occurred and especially that it was young students who were affected and whose rights were violated in the city of Iguala.\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s predecessor, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, also faced wave after wave of police corruption scandals, with some entire local forces dismissed. But experts say that, even as violence soared, both administrations fell behind in putting in place measures to hold law enforcement authorities accountable.Only this year did Mexico pass a law allowing members of the military to be tried in civilian courts for human rights abuses, and many feel that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has been more focused on shifting the dialogue to Mexico\u2019s economy than on fighting corruption and improving security.\u201cA serious and sustained effort at reforming local police agencies has been a pending agenda for a long time in Mexico,\u201d said Matthew C. Ingram, an assistant professor at the University at Albany who studies justice in Mexico. \u201cAs long as local, municipal police agencies remain weak, they will not have the capacity to generate public trust or resist corruption and capture.\u201dHere at the small, 500-student mountaintop teachers college, Escuela Normal Rural Ra\u00fal Isidro Burgos, where cows and stray dogs roam freely and walls are adorned with slogans like \u201cprotest is a right, repression is a crime,\u201d a hodgepodge of human rights and radical groups and representatives of the families have vowed paralyzing strikes across the country on Wednesday to keep the pressure on the authorities for answers.Parents of the missing students doubt the effectiveness of state investigators. A team of forensic experts from Argentina with long experience in mass disappearance cases has arrived, and on Monday it began interviewing family members and collecting other data as part of an independent investigation, though it was unclear if the experts would have access to the bodies found.States officials said it could take at least two weeks and possibly longer to identify the remains because of their poor condition.And if the bodies are not those of the missing students, the question remains: Where did they come from?Several parents said they still hoped their children would be found alive. Although the number of missing has fluctuated, the current list of 43 was developed after students and human rights representatives said they had called family members and friends and searched school grounds and other places, failing to account for 43 classmates.\u201cWe have to keep looking and praying,\u201d said Santa Cruz Castro, the father of Leonel.He last spoke to his son when Leonel called him the day of the confrontation, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad, I am going to the march,\u201d which Mr. Cruz took to mean the collection drive in Iguala. \u201cAnd then I didn\u2019t hear from him and saw the news about the shootings. We didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201dIn a sign of defiance and concern, placards and bumper stickers are popping up here and in other cities in Guerrero on buses, storefronts and buildings. Their slogan \u2014 #HastaEncontrarlos \u2014 means: \u201cUntil they are found.\u201dAdvertisement"}
