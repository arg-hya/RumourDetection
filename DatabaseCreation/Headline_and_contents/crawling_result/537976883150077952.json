However, she was not acting alone: a number of family\n  members, including her husband, daughter and youngest son, rushed\n  along to help and provided her with ammunition.\n\"The fighting intensified when we reached the battlefield\n  along with light and heavy weapons,\" said Reza Gul\u2019s\n  daughter-in-law, Seema, according to TOLOnews. \"We were\n  committed to fight until the last bullet.\" She added that\n  the intense fighting lasted a number of hours, with 25 militants\n  left dead and others wounded.\n#Afghan\n    Mother Kills 25 #Talibanhttp://t.co/xk9yb9VCnVpic.twitter.com/zQgHR4qwsf\n    \u2014 TOLOnews (@TOLOnews) November\n    24, 2014\n  Reza Gul\u2019s daughter Fatima says, \u201cWe started a kind of family\n  war against the Taliban.\u201d She added that she helped to\n  prepare bullets for her mother and father to fight off the\n  militant organization. Reza Gul\u2019s husband Abdul Satar said they\n  were prepared to sacrifice the whole family to ensure that the\n  Taliban would not encroach on their lands.\n\"My young son who was a police officer was killed in front of\n  my eyes,\" Abdul Satar said, as reported by TOLOnews. \"I\n  pulled aside his dead body and started fighting to defend my soil\n  to prove that this is the soil of Malalai, the hero. I was\n  committed to give up my life, but not my son's check post.\"\n  He was referring to Malalai of Maiwand, an Afghan folk hero who\n  allegedly helped to defeat the British in the second Anglo-Afghan\n  war in 1880.\n\n  The provincial police chief, General Abdul Razaq Yagubi,\n  confirmed that the Taliban had launched an attack on Balabolok\n  district on November 17. He also added that they came with an\n  estimated 400 fighters to try and take the area.\n\n  Safiullah was the head of the local police post and had 10 other\n  policemen under his control. However their post was shelled by\n  Taliban militants and Safiullah was killed in the resulting\n  firefight. His mother's presence \u201cboosted the morale of\n  policemen resisting the attack, and after seven hours of heavy\n  fighting, the Taliban fled. At least 25 Taliban militants were\n  killed and 31 injured in that village alone,\u201d Yagubi added,\n  NBC reported.\n\n  It appears Raza Gul\u2019s actions could go down in folklore and she\n  could well become the new Malalai of Maiwand.\n\"We are proud of the bravery of this family and this is a\n  saga that will be remembered for long by police and residents of\n  Farah province,\" Yagubi added.\n\n  Afghans are fiercely loyal to their homes and these sentiments\n  were confirmed by the family\u2019s youngest son, Sardar, who has a\n  word of warning for the Taliban if they ever think of returning.\n\"The Taliban are foreigners, they are servants of Pakistan,\n  if they attack 100 other times, I will continue to defend my\n  country and will shed their blood to not let them dare to enter\n  my village,\u201d said Sardar, who also helped to prepare bullets\n  for his mother and father, according to TOLOnews.\nRT News App\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132021.
