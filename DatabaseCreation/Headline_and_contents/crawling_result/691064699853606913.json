Thanks for following along, everybody.\u00a0Enjoy Sunday\u2019s snowball fights!10:20 p.m. ET:\u00a0As we close down the live blog, I wanted to share one final story from earlier this afternoon: Meteorologists at the National Weather Service office in Sterling, Virginia (near D.C.\u2019s Dulles airport), like so many other people across the Northeast, were snowed in completely\u2014but they needed to bring in reinforcements for the evening shift. So they did what the rest of us wished we could: They called in the National Guard. Bryan Jackson, one of the meteorologists, described what happened in a media chat: \u201cWith the assistance of the Army National Guard, 3rd and 116th Infantry Divisions, we are able to get staff into and out of the office here in Sterling. We are 100 percent operational.\u201dThank you to the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the @VaNationalGuard for their help during the #winterstorm pic.twitter.com/4gOwT0pRHw10:00 p.m. ET:\u00a0As this historic snowstorm winds to a close, there\u2019s meteorological scandal afoot in the D.C. area. The Washington Post\u2019s Capital Weather Gang reports the city\u2019s official snowfall observations, taken across the Potomac River by FAA contractors at National Airport, may have been conducted improperly. The issue is that a snow board, which helps provide a more accurate measurement, was not used\u2014even though it is required by NWS guidelines. Jordan Tessler, a D.C.\u2013area meteorologist, conducted a quick analysis arguing that D.C.\u2019s official snow total should be more like 19.5 inches rather than the 17.8 that tentatively was measured. While that may not seem like a huge difference, it would move this storm into third place in D.C. history\u2014up from the current No. 4 ranking. Things like this matter\u00a0to die-hard weather nerds, and also to the historical record city officials use for planning for future storms. The Weather Channel reports the National Weather Service has \u201cretracted\u201d the measurement in question\u2014which will likely be examined by the National Weather Service in more detail, and possibly adjusted.7:50 p.m. ET:\u00a0Oh yeah, and it\u2019s official now: This is the snowiest day in New York City history.Greatest 1-day snowfall in #NYC Central Park history- now 25 inches-what a storm! #blizzard2016 #Snowzilla #Jonas pic.twitter.com/64a2zuTnnD7:30 p.m. ET:\u00a0We\u2019re closing in on the final hours of the Blizzard of 2016. The latest numbers, as of 7 p.m., along with their new all-time snowstorm rankings: 26 inches in Baltimore (3rd), 25.1 inches at Central Park in NYC (3rd), 20.8 inches in Philadelphia (6th), and 17.8 inches at National Airport in D.C. (exactly tying the 2010 Snowmageddon storm for 4th place)\u2014though there\u2019s 28.3 inches at Dulles Airport (2nd all-time) just west of D.C., which might be more representative of the suburbs there.7:30 p.m. ET:\u00a0About a half hour away from the evening high tide in New York City, and it doesn\u2019t appear that water levels will top Saturday morning\u2019s high tide. Great news.6:50 p.m. ET:\u00a0A technical discussion from the National Weather Service says that snowfall rates from D.C. to NYC to southern Massachusetts will \u201cslowly diminish\u201d through midnight, but isolated bands may continue producing 1 to 2 inches of snow per hour during that time. One such band is currently camped out directly over New York City, where the snow may not totally stop for another 10 hours or so.6:30 p.m. ET:\u00a0New York City may be leading when it comes to official snowfall totals, but D.C. may have their northern neighbors beat when it comes to spirit. Take this D.C. police cruiser, for example, that was spotted blasting the soundrack from Frozen\u00a0to warm the hearts of passersby:that's it. DC wins #Snowzilla for this 'Frozen' soundtrack police cruiser @EricHolthaus @byaaroncdavis pic.twitter.com/BD7pX4j5Ck6:00 p.m. ET:\u00a0This is already, or will very soon become, the biggest one-day snowfall total on record in New York City. Two hours ago, Central Park had 19.3 inches but hasn\u2019t reported since (which is normal). As of 6 p.m., JFK airport has recorded a stunning 26 inches\u2014surpassing its single-day record of 21.6 inches set during the Presidents Day storm of February 2003. The snow is falling at an exceedingly heavy two inches per hour rate in the city, and shows no immediate signs of lessening. These records are slightly different than the snowstorm\u00a0records, which cover a three-day period. NYC\u2019s single snowstorm record is 26.9 inches set in February 2010\u2014which this storm is currently on pace to break.5:40 p.m. ET:\u00a0For the time being, it looks like New York City has surpassed Washington, D.C.\u2019s snow total\u2014at least according to official measurements. As of 4 p.m., there\u2019s 19.3 inches of snow at Central Park in NYC, and at 5 p.m. there was 17.5 inches at National Airport in D.C. NWS forecasters in NYC are expecting another 6 or 7 inches, and D.C. is expecting at least another 2 or 3.5:00 p.m. ET:\u00a0Here are the latest snow totals champions by state: (In some cases, literally they are Champions. Champion, Pennsylvania now has 23 inches of snow.)Updated. Check out the town in your state that has received the most snow. #blizzard2016 #Jonas #Snowzilla pic.twitter.com/g7nyZxoef83:20 p.m. ET:\u00a0For days, meteorologists (including, humbly, myself) have been warning of the coastal flooding risk associated with this exceptionally strong blizzard. Due to the storm\u2019s exceptionally long duration, there will be three high tides expected to create damaging coastal flooding. During this morning\u2019s high tide, the first of these, at least for some cities in Delaware and New Jersey, the top-end scenario came to pass. Hurricane-like conditions in Delaware ripped siding off houses as winds gusted above hurricane force\u00a0with 21-foot waves just offshore. In Atlantic City, a few dozen residents were forced from their homes, and several people were rescued from their homes by emergency crews in Ocean City. On Twitter, NWS forecaster Gary Szatkowski said\u00a0of this morning\u2019s flood\u00a0\u201csometimes your worst fears do come true.\u201d Here\u2019s a roundup of images from this morning\u2019s impressive high tides across the Mid-Atlantic:\u00a0#WATCH: Flooding Shuts Down New Jersey Bridge. @CleveBryan Has The Latest: https://t.co/6C1iV56PRo #CBS3Snow pic.twitter.com/Sa3ybFEJ4UA live look at #RehobothBeach, Delaware.

I\u2019ve been tweeting with Adam Sobel, the Columbia University professor who literally wrote the book on Sandy\u2019s flood, and he\u2019s thinking the afternoon high tide may create top-10 all-time coastal water levels in New York Harbor, close to levels reached during Hurricane Irene in 2011. This won\u2019t be anywhere close to Sandy levels\u2014that can\u2019t be stressed enough\u2014but especially low-lying parts of the city like JFK airport and some sea walls in Manhattan and Brooklyn may be overtopped. During Irene, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg famously closed the entire subway system, the first time that had ever happened. In a post-storm analysis, it was discovered that water levels came within a foot of flooding the subways, which of course actually happened just the next year during Sandy.\u00a0Storm surge in NY harbor is over 4' & rising. It's low tide now. Could well get over seawalls later. #noreaster pic.twitter.com/kIF6WhOlSG2:30 p.m. ET:\u00a0New York City roads are now completely closed to nonemergency traffic. As the city hunkers down, the snow totals continue to rack up. At 1 p.m., there was 16.5 inches in Newark, N.J., 16.2 inches at LaGuardia Airport in Queens and 14.7 inches in Central Park. Meanwhile, after a midday lull, Washington, D.C.\u2019s official total now stands at 14.9 inches, though nearly twice that has been measured in the surrounding suburbs.Clinton st, Brooklyn #jonas #blizzard2016 @tristateweather @weatherchannel @JimCantore @EricHolthaus @brklynbes pic.twitter.com/tJeb11r72sTHE SNOW IS BLOWING SIDEWAYS. #snowmaggedon2016 pic.twitter.com/1s1JA26yeS12:50 p.m. ET:\u00a0New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has announced a travel ban in New York City, effective at 2:30 p.m. Saturday. All city roads will close to civilian traffic, including buses, and elevated subways will close at 4 p.m. as well. All Broadway shows will also be canceled Saturday.12:45 p.m. ET:\u00a0One of the oldest cities in America, Lewes, Delaware, recorded its worst coastal flood in history Saturday morning in association with this blizzard. There\u2019s a bulletproof direct link to climate change here: Sea levels in Lewes have risen by more than a foot over the last 100 years, meaning this flood would not have been as bad if not for global warming.11:55 a.m. ET:\u00a0At a midday press conference, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said the city was considering a total travel ban in response to the recently boosted snowfall forecast. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s come into the city from the suburbs should\u00a0turn around and go back.\u00a0This is very, very fast accumulation, and I guarantee if people linger they will get stuck,\u201d he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has also declared a state of emergency for the region.11:20 a.m. ET:\u00a0Just as I posted the update below, the National Weather Service in NYC greatly boosted their snow total forecast. A whopping 24-30 inches is now expected in Central Park, where the city\u2019s official snow records are kept. At the top end, that would mean this blizzard would become the single snowiest since those records began, in 1869.NWS10:55 a.m. ET:\u00a0This blizzard is just now hitting its stride, the National Weather Service has warned in a technical forecast discussion. They\u2019re calling for a period of up to 2 inch per hour snowfall from D.C. to Baltimore to Philadelphia to NYC to southern Connecticut through midday \u201cand beyond.\u201d Just across the Hudson River from New York City, parts of New Jersey have already hit the one foot mark, with about 20 hours of snow left to go. This storm may now challenge New York City\u2019s biggest single snowfall on record, 26.9 inches in February 2006. In a separate forecast discussion, the NWS in NYC warns that weather models continue to indicate significantly more snow than their relatively conservative forecast (below) shows.NWS10:10 a.m. ET:\u00a0Sure, an astronaut tweeting from space is pretty cool, but astronaut tweeting a picture of THUNDERSNOW from space?! You, sir, just won the Internet forever. Update, 10:18 a.m.:\u00a0Of course, the omniscient Capital Weather Gang at the Washington Post immediately points out that the lightning in Scott Kelly\u2019s image from the space station was probably in a regular rain-making thunderstorm out over the ocean. They\u2019re right, but I refuse to lose hope.Rare #thundersnow visible from @Space_Station in #blizzard2016! #Snowzilla #snowmaggedon2016 #YearInSpace pic.twitter.com/l3p6hjnJOq9:35 a.m. ET:\u00a0In Nashville, where snow isn\u2019t common, weather has delayed the Tennessean\u2019s delivery today. But the front page story could warm even the coldest of hearts: A couple married on the city\u2019s pedestrian bridge in the middle of the snowstorm. \u201cEven in the middle of thundersnow, love wins.\u201dToday's weather has delayed delivery of The Tennessean. Read the E-Edition here: https://t.co/rBFsbG7mAQ pic.twitter.com/RlvcIraBaB9:15 a.m. ET:\u00a0It\u2019s majorly blizzarding in New York City right now, but meanwhile, just 50 miles north\u2014there\u2019s nary a flake in the sky. This time Friday, forecasters were still torn on how far north the sharp northern cutoff of this storm would reach. We now have the answer.\u00a0Just a bit of snow in #timessquare #nyc https://t.co/Uxzk43XIwI pic.twitter.com/toLhnQwntEMeanwhile 50 miles north of NYC, just a few flakes. pic.twitter.com/bfZ71ZStHc8:20 a.m. ET:\u00a0A roundup of impacts so far: In Kentucky, the Associated Press reports the Red Cross is providing aid to a group of perhaps \u201cthousands\u201d of motorists stranded in a massive 35-mile\u2013long traffic jam on I-75 for as much as 10 hours overnight. The National Guard and Kentucky State Police are working to clear the jam, south of Lexington, one car at a time.Also, tens of thousands of people are without power in New Jersey, and a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police says officers have responded to 989 crashes and 793 disabled vehicles so far across that state. CNN reports that 11 states have declared a state of emergency.Here's an update from @BeccaWBIR on the Interstate 75 standstill in Kentucky https://t.co/e92jFveg6Z pic.twitter.com/lmKZQEDWD47:40 a.m. ET:\u00a0As we reach high tide, it looks like the top-end coastal flooding projections for this storm have unfortunately panned out. In Lewes, Delaware, this storm has now eclipsed the flooding mark set during Hurricane Sandy (8.71 ft)\u2014along with winds gusting above 70 mph. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to worry about a Sandy repeat in Northern New Jersey or New York City or Long Island, though, this storm\u2019s energy is focused further south where Sandy wasn\u2019t \u201cas bad.\u201d7:30 a.m. ET:\u00a0This storm is really hitting its stride in the New York City area, too\u2014and much earlier than expected: There\u2019s already six inches on the ground in Central Park as of 7 am, according to official measurements. It\u2019ll snow like this for the next 24 hours there.7:23 a.m. EST: Water level at Lewes, Delaware, is at 9.07 feet. Second highest level on record. Image: NOAA #Jonas pic.twitter.com/77l4eKkzrt7:20 a.m. ET:\u00a0The snow is really starting to pile up in the D.C. area. There\u2019s about 12-18 inches on the ground right now, almost half of that just within the last 4 or 5 hours. At National Airport, D.C.\u2019s official snow measuring site, there\u2019s 14 inches\u2014good enough for the city\u2019s 12th biggest snowstorm in history, and this storm is probably only half over.@uscapitol crew working hard @3am to clean up drifts #blizzard2016 #Snowzilla @wusa9 @washingtonian @capitalweather pic.twitter.com/OBEHF7O96uOfficially 14\" at National Airport, already ranks as 12th biggest storm in D.C., closing quickly on Top 107:00 a.m. ET:\u00a0Thundersnow! Slate\u2019s science editor Laura Helmuth has spotted that most joyous of all meteorological phenomena at her home in the D.C. area, and she wasn\u2019t the only one. She says: \u201cWe had some tremendous thundersnow this morning at about 6 a.m. in Rockville. Bright flash, extremely long-lasting thunder peal.\u201d Awww, yeah. There\u2019s some real science at work here too: Thundersnow is an indicator of extremely heavy snowfall rates.Thundersnow!!!! @capitalweather #Snowzilla pic.twitter.com/3Ll7mYMSF7Lightning showing up W of #Baltimore and N of DC - thundersnow time @JimCantore #blizzard2016 #Snowzilla #Jonas pic.twitter.com/REXPR4AFu2Thundersnow with lightning. Hurricane force winds with flood warnings in Ocean City. When the last time y'all read your bible. Get right.11:30 p.m. ET:\u00a0Overnight weather models are in, and once again, they\u2019re showing the storm pushing further north than previously expected. This trend, as well as the storm\u2019s stronger-than-expected showing so far\u2014parts of the D.C. area already have 10 inches!\u2014have prompted the NWS forecasters in New York City to go all in.\u00a0Here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking for the rest of the storm: For D.C., an additional 15-20 inches\u2014which would challenge the city\u2019s all-time snowfall record. This is a crippling amount of snow, and it will probably take days for the city to get moving again. Baltimore and Philadelphia should also wind up with a 20-25 inch storm total. New York City, which was expecting just 5-10 inches this morning, should now prepare for 18-24, ranking among the city\u2019s five worst snowstorms since the Civil War. Saturday from 8 a.m. to midnight will be the storm\u2019s peak, with heaviest snowfall rates, strongest winds (with gusts up to 50 mph), and most blizzard-y conditions. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask your neighbors for help if you\u2019re caught off-guard by the sudden boost in the forecast. In my six years in New York City, big snowstorms were an amazing, magical time. Enjoy it, and stay safe.9:00 p.m. ET:\u00a0This blizzard, whatever you want to call it\u2014#Blizzard2016, #Snowzilla, or #DavidSnowie\u2014is still about a day or so away from peak strength. It\u2019s been wow\u2019ing meteorologists for days via computer model projections, and now it\u2019s wow\u2019ing them with spectacular satellite images like the one below.The snowstorm is a beautiful monster, winding up as it moves across the Southeast US #Snowzilla #blizzard2016 #Jonas pic.twitter.com/V8n3QmbZA68:10 p.m. ET:\u00a0This week, Slate collected some fabulous reader questions about the impending megablizzard. While we have a few minutes, I wanted to share my favorite that was left on the editor\u2019s chopping block:\u00a0Just how big of a snowball fight could we have with the snow this thing is going to dump on the east coasters? Is there enough for everyone in the country to have say, 10 snowballs, which would probably be the minimum acceptable level for a true fight?Here\u2019s my answer: Let\u2019s see, there are 320 million people in the USA, and the snow will fall over about 100,000 square miles at an average depth of, let\u2019s say, 10 inches. There are about 4 billion square inches in a square mile, which means the total amount of snow will be about 4 quadrillion cubic inches of snow. That means each American gets about 12,000,000 cubic inches of snow, enough for about 7,000 snowballs for every man, woman, and child in the country.\u00a0This doesn\u2019t factor in the inevitable melt during the transportation and distribution process, so you\u2019re on your own to figure out how that part\u2019s going to work. But basically, yes.7:30 p.m. ET:\u00a0Snow has been falling for about eight hours in D.C. now, and streets are beginning to resemble winter wonderlands. The National Weather Service says snow should fall at up to one inch per hour during the evening hours before picking up overnight.

Power outages are already piling up across the Carolinas, and the video below is a great example of why. The last gasp of power in Oakwood.A post shared by  INDY Week (@indyweek) on Jan 22, 2016 at 3:12pm PST6:40 p.m. ET:\u00a0While the storm gathers steam and heavier snow begins to spread northward, some have found solace in the live video feed\u00a0of snow piling up on the National Mall from Paul Ryan\u2019s office in the U.S. Capitol. The music\u2014and the comments section\u2014are definitely worth the trip. Update, 7:00 p.m.: GQ Magazine calls Ryan\u2019s choice of music a \u201cgorgeous piece of tropical sex jam perfection.\u201d5:20 p.m. ET:\u00a0If, like me, you\u2019re weirdly obsessed\u2014already!!\u2014with checking how much snow is piling up in your neighborhood and are too lazy/cold to go outside and check the sidewalk yourself, the National Weather Service will be issuing reports about once every two hours throughout the duration of the storm compiling reports from people that are brave enough to take their own measurements. Here\u2019s the links for D.C./Baltimore, Philly, and NYC. Also, if that\u2019s not enough of a guilt trip, here\u2019s the proper way of measuring snow if you\u2019d like to do a science and help out forecasters during this historic snowstorm.Latest NWS snow map for NYC.(best guess left, worst case right)Up about 4\u201d from this am.https://t.co/UC9OScO7he pic.twitter.com/fyGz5sgpOO4:30 p.m. ET:\u00a0Light snow has been falling for a few hours now in Washington, D.C., where the heaviest totals of this storm are expected\u2014but meteorologists a bit further north are beginning to get a little nervous. Today\u2019s last-minute weather models threw fresh uncertainty on just how far north the sharp cut-off of multi-foot snow totals might reach, and National Weather Service forecasters in Philadelphia and New York City have significantly boosted their snow projections in response. There\u2019s now likely to be 20 inches of snow in Philly, up from a range of 12-18 just this morning.4:05 p.m. ET:\u00a0Welcome to Slate\u2019s blizzard live blog!
