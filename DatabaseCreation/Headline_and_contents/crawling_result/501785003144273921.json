They\u2019re being brutal for no reason. None of us were violent. We were just there.\u201dNiere estimated that about 20 law enforcement officers, all from St. Louis County, descended on his truck. He said that they were protesting near the QuikTrip station, a landmark of the demonstrations, when police began firing tear gas.He said that his group walked through a residential neighborhood to get to the truck, with the intention of driving away.\u201cThey said that we just looked like the type that were going to stir up drama and go start looting,\u201d said another person from the same group, Tina Hanna, 24, of the St. Louis suburb of Florissant.

He\u2019s with all of us. The brutality that we face as black Americans, you can face the same brutality as a white American. I just want to let the world know that all of the stuff that\u2019s going on in Jennings, in Ferguson \u2014 there is no outsiders because we are all one.\u201dThe Highway Patrol is in charge of security in Ferguson, backed by the Missouri National Guard.
