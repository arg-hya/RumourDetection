Donald Trump expressed his opinion on Wednesday, January 20, about celebrities boycotting the 2016 Oscars over the lack of minority nominees \u2014 and the presidential hopeful has only riled up more scandal with his latest remarks. Trump, 69, followed Stacey Dash\u2018s lead on Fox & Friends, where both guests were asked about the Academy Awards brouhaha. Dash, a Fox contributor, called out Black Entertainment Television (BET) for giving awards largely to black people. \u201cI think it\u2019s ludicrous, because we have to make up our minds,\u201d the Clueless alum, 49, told Steve Doocy. \u201cEither we want to have segregation or integration. If we don\u2019t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards, where you\u2019re only awarded if you\u2019re black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms. It\u2019s a double standard.\u201dLater in the show, Trump weighed in. \u201cI saw somebody on your show today say, \u2018Well, what do we do with BET?'\u201d said the real estate mogul, who called into the program the morning after Sarah Palin endorsed him for president. \u201cThe whites don\u2019t get any nominations, and I thought it was an amazing interview, actually. I\u2019ve never even thought of it from that standpoint.\u201dHe continued: \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve watched over the years where African Americans have in fact received Academy Awards and have in fact been represented,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd this is not one of those years, but over the years I\u2019ve seen numerous black actors and African American actors receive awards and I think that\u2019s great. This doesn\u2019t happen to be one of those years. \u2026 It\u2019s a difficult situation.\u201dThe Oscars uproar started last Thursday, January 14, after the 2016 nominees were announced and none of the actors represented in the major categories were nonwhite. Host Chris Rock also joked that this year\u2019s show is the \u201cwhite BET Awards.\u201d Then, on Monday, the situation escalated when both Jada Pinkett Smith and director Spike Lee said they were not attending the show.In response, Will Smith\u2019s former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air costar Janet Hubert slammed the Concussion actor and his wife in a video message about their reactions to the nominees.\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t deserve a nomination,\u201d Hubert, 60, who played Aunt Vivian on the sitcom from 1990 to 1993, said to the actor. \u201cI didn\u2019t think, frankly, you deserved a Golden Globe nomination. \u2026 Y\u2019all need to get over yourselves. \u2026 You are a part of Hollywood. You are a part of the system that is unfair to other actors.\u201d\u00a0The 2016 Oscars will air on Sunday, February 28, at 7 p.m. EST on ABC.
