The approaches have all been tested and all have shown concrete results. By bringing them together, WHO hopes to dramatically reduce instances of violence against children.\nOver the past year, up to 1 billion children have experienced physical, sexual or psychological violence, according to a recent study published in \u201cPediatrics\u201d. Homicide is among the top 5 causes of death for adolescents. 1 in 4 children suffer physical abuse, and nearly 1 in 5 girls are sexually abused at least once in their lives.\nThe 7 strategies highlighted in the \u201cINSPIRE\u201d package are:\n\u201cKnowledge about the extent and harms of violence against children is growing, together with evidence about effective strategies for prevention\u201d, notes Dr Etienne Krug, Director at WHO. \u201cNow we need to build on that knowledge to work collectively to create the safe, stable, and nurturing environments that protect children and adolescents from violent harm.\u201d\nThe new package has been produced in collaboration with partners including: End Violence Against Children, Together for Girls, UNICEF, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), US Agency for International Development (USAID), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the World Bank. The package is being released in the context of the worldwide launch of the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children. \nThe partnership aims to bring together governments, UN agencies, civil society, the private sector, researchers, and academics to build political will, promote solutions, accelerate action and strengthen collaboration to prevent violence against children. WHO is a founding member of the partnership, and will support work to implement strategies in countries. \nThe initiative also aims to support achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular SDG target 16.2 to \u201cend abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children\u201d, and implementation of World Health Assembly resolution WHA69.5 on the \u201cWHO global plan of action to strengthen the role of the health system within a national multisectoral response to address interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children\u201d.Subscribe to our newsletters \u2192Media Contacts Paul Garwood\r\n                        Communications Officer\r\n                            WHO                    MoreINSPIRE\n\n7 strategies for ending violence against children\n\nEnd violence against children\n\nThe Global Partnership\n\nWe Protect\n\nEnding child sexual exploitation online\n\nMore from WHO\n\nDraft global plan of action on violence\nFact sheet on child maltreatment\nQ&A on child maltreatement\nMore about child abuse\nINSPIREEnd violence against childrenWe ProtectMore from WHO"}
