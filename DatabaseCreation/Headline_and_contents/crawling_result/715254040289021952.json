During a town hall event that set to air on MSNBC Wednesday night, host Chris Matthews insisted that Trump could not dodge the question of how to enforce an abortion ban. \"Look, people in certain parts of the Republican Party, conservative Republicans, would say, \u2018Yes, it should,\u2019\u201d Trump replied, according to a transcript obtained by Bloomberg. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a very serious problem and it\u2019s a problem we have to decide on. Are you going to send them to jail?\u201d\u201cThere has to be some form of punishment,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the woman?\u201d Matthews pressed. \"Yeah,\" Trump replied, adding that the punishment would \"have to be determined.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve set the law and frankly the judges, you\u2019re going to have a very big election coming up for that reason because you have judges where it\u2019s a real tipping point and with the loss of Scalia, who was a very strong conservative, this presidential election is going to be very important,\u201d the candidate opined. \"When you say what\u2019s the law, nobody knows what the law is going to be. It depends on who gets elected.\" The US Department of Homeland Security issued a new terrorism threat advisory on Friday ahead of the anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks and amid a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\t\n\t\tThe National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin said the United States faces a \"heightened threat environment\" from both domestic terrorists \"and those inspired or motivated by foreign terrorists and other malign foreign influences.\"\n\tOn MSNBC Friday, Rachel Maddow broke the news that investigators in Georgia who are probing former President Donald Trump's efforts to influence the vote count are also considering the new evidence that Trump tried to strongarm the Justice Department into helping him.\"There is also a story I want to give you an update on that we have been covering intensively all this week ... it is the still-unspooling scandal involving the U.S. Department of Justice at the end of the Trump administration,\" said Maddow. \"We can report tonight that according to a person familiar with the investigation, these new revelations, this new reporting, about how Trump and Jeff Clark apparently targeted Georgia in this plot, those new revelations are considered, quote, 'relevant and useful' by the investigators in the Fulton County District Attorney's office, who have opened a criminal investigation into President Trump's alleged efforts to interfere with elections' officials in Georgia after the November election.\"Donald Trump, who never met a fact or figure he didn't want to distort, desperately wanted to prevent the Census Bureau from getting an accurate count of the people living in America. So his administration pursued \"policies that suppress the count among hard-to-count communities \u2014 including immigrants, people of color, low-income individuals, and those in rural areas \u2014 and effectively disenfranchise them,\" according to a 2020 report by Vox and the Center for Public Integrity.
