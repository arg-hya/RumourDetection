In the film, they play Barack and Michelle Obama (n\u00e9e Robinson) as they were in 1989: he, a Harvard Law summer associate at a prestigious Chicago firm, and she, an ambitious young lawyer and his adviser. Telling the story of their first date, it\u2019s the first major depiction of the Obamas in a feature film, and Sawyers and Sumpter portray the future first couple with such sweetness and magnetism that you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking them an item offscreen. But it didn\u2019t come without baggage. \u201cI was worried that the CIA would come shut us down!\u201d Sumpter says, laughing. \u201cIt is the leader of the free world, after all.\u201dThe actress, who also serves as a producer on the film, was on board with the project from the beginning, but Sawyers may never have gotten the part it weren\u2019t for a technical glitch. When the 32-year-old actor, who was born and raised in Indianapolis but lives in London, sent in his first audition tape, he was doing a pitch-perfect impersonation of the president at 54, rather than at 28. After he didn\u2019t hear back, he readied a second tape \u2014 which never made it to the film\u2019s director, Richard Tanne. \u201cMy wife and I did the tape, edited it, and were trying to upload it to Vimeo, but it was going super slow,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like 36 percent loaded, and it was late in London, so all I could think was, \u2018God, I\u2019m going to be up another couple hours.\u2019\u201d Just as the tape was about to send, Sawyers received an email from his manager with notes from Tanne telling him to strip back his performance. He adjusted accordingly, and was soon awarded the part, his first lead role in a film. \u201cThank God for slow Wi-Fi,\u201d he says.For Sumpter, 35, whose past credits include the CW teen series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d and the 2014 action comedy \u201cRide Along,\u201d playing the First Lady was always about \u201cembodying her essence\u201d rather than straight imitation. She employed a dialect coach to nail her speech patterns and picked up clues about her life as a young woman from the memoir \u201cA Game of Character,\u201d written by Michelle\u2019s brother, Craig Robinson. Both Sumpter and Sawyers listened to recordings of the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Gwendolyn Brooks and read Ralph Ellison\u2019s \u201cInvisible Man,\u201d trying to put themselves in the context of the young couple when they first fell in love. Sawyers even smoked Obama\u2019s preferred Marlboro cigarettes \u2014 which can be seen throughout the film \u2014 and scoured YouTube for clips of the president during candid moments. \u201cThere\u2019s a video from the 2014 midterm election when he\u2019s voting and some guy goes, \u2018Don\u2019t touch my girlfriend,\u2019 and he says, \u2018I really wasn\u2019t planning on it.\u2019 He could ignore the guy, but he made a joke instead. And he\u2019s the president!\u201d\u201cSouthside With You\u201d won fans at its premiere, but it has yet to reach its most famous audience: the Obamas. During a Q&A after the screening, Tanne said the president and first lady are aware of the film, if \u201ca little baffled by its existence.\u201d For their part, the actors are cautiously optimistic about the couple seeing their work. \u201cI\u2019d probably just stare at him and wait for him to speak,\u201d says Sawyers. \u201cI\u2019d honestly be honored for him to see anything I\u2019ve done, let alone me playing him.\u201d As for the question of whether he thinks the film can reach both sides of the political divide, Sawyers is more confident. \u201cIf people on the right do want to see it, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll walk away delighted,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the answer to the age-old question at any dinner party: How did you meet? What was your first date like?\u201d Adds Sumpter, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t relate to love?\u201dAdvertisement"}
