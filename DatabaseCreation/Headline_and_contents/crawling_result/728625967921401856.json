(Photo: Kris Tripplaar/Sipa USA/Newscom)Target\u2019s stock has dropped and more than 1 million consumers have pledged to boycott the retail giant after it announced an \u201cinclusive\u201d policy allowing individuals to use the restroom or fitting room of their choice, based on their gender identity.\u201cIn our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways,\u201d Target announced April 19. \u201cMost relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.\u201dTarget common stock dropped from opening price of\u00a0$83.50 per share\u00a0April 19 to a closing price of\u00a0$79.99 per share\u00a0May 3\u2014a 4.2 percent decline over the past two weeks.\u00a0Its\u00a0closing price of $83.98 on April 19 was the highest since July 2015.\u201cTarget\u2019s policy is exactly how sexual predators get access to their victims,\u201d the American Family Association, a nonprofit that supports Christians values, wrote April 20. \u201cAnd with Target publicly boasting that men can enter women\u2019s bathrooms, where do you think predators are going to go?\u201dThe group continued in an updated website message:Clearly, Target\u2019s dangerous new policy poses a danger to wives and daughters. Over 1 million people agree with us and pledged to boycott Target stores until protecting women and children is a priority.More than 1.15 million consumers have signed the American Family Association\u2019s pledge to boycott Target, the \u201cbest response\u201d the organization says it has had to a campaign in a short amount of time. \u00a0We are announcing boycott of @Target due to their dangerous bathroom policy. https://t.co/GQI0Oe8VAO #BoycottTarget pic.twitter.com/RB11tfeXDW\u2014 American Family Assc (@AmericanFamAssc) April 21, 2016\u201cTarget stocks are dropping. They started dropping the day we announced this boycott,\u201d Sandy Rios, the group\u2019s director of government affairs, told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon.The American Family Association suggests that Target keep restrooms for males and females separate, but also have a single occupancy, unisex restroom available.YouGov\u2019s BrandIndex tracked data that shows Target\u2019s consumer perception went down after the transgender bathroom announcement. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a statement that people aren\u2019t in favor of equal rights for transgender people,\u201d YouGov CEO Ted Marzilli told USA Today. \u201cIt shows people just kind of demonstrating that they\u2019re uncomfortable, or uncertain about how comfortable they are, with mixed public restrooms.\u201dTarget spokeswoman Molly Snyder declined to comment to the Associated Press\u00a0on whether\u00a0the protests had affected sales at its stores.\nThe Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you.
