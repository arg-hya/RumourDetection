The tag is dumb, yes, but so are these people.\n\nthey called them angry dudes in oregon #YallQaeda waging #YeeHawd, and i almost died.\u2014 atmosphere (@atmosphere) January 3, 2016\nthey called them angry dudes in oregon #YallQaeda waging #YeeHawd, and i almost died.\n\nEvery successful revolution starts with takeover of closed visitor center with gift shop. #OregonUnderAttack #YallQaeda\u2014 Lars Petticord (@fatdownjacket) January 3, 2016\nEvery successful revolution starts with takeover of closed visitor center with gift shop. #OregonUnderAttack #YallQaedaMeanwhile, the standoff, which was sparked by the arson conviction of two men over cattle grazing rights, continues. Earlier this weekend, the men were joined by the sons of noted anti-federalist and racist Cliven Bundy, and told media that they would be willing to kill or be killed if it comes to that. The Oregonian reports that the police, however have been keeping a low profile:During Saturday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally, not a police officer was visible. And so far law enforcement agencies have not approached the refuge or blocked access to the territory.Maybe, in the year 2016, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all just allowed to wave rifles in the air and take over federal buildings whenever we want to! Maybe this has nothing to do with the gaping disparity between the way black and white people with guns (or without guns) are treated in the U.S. On second thought, maybe not.Contact the author at melissa.cronin@gawker.com."}
