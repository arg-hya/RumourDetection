The model incorporates weather and electricity demand in 60-minute increments over 13-kilometer blocks in the 48 contiguous states.The model held nuclear and hydropower at 2012 levels, included land-use restrictions and demand growth, and projected energy production costs out to 2030, including production and transmission.With an objective of reducing costs, researchers found that onshore wind and solar power could meet electricity demands at a levelized cost of energy comparable to 2012 levels, roughly 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour.In a scenario where renewables were more expensive than current projections, the model created an energy system in 2030 that cut emissions 33 percent below 1990 levels while producing electricity at 8.6 cents per kWh.A scenario where renewable energy prices dropped and natural gas prices rose created a system producing electricity at 10 cents per kWh and cutting emissions by 78 percent.As renewable energy takes up a larger share of the generation mix, large-scale weather effects end up reducing intermittency.This challenges assumptions that more renewables on the grid would require more dispatchable generators like natural-gas-fired turbines or energy storage, both costly options for utilities.Not waiting for a breakthrough\r\nThe NEWS model found that energy storage would not be cost-effective at current prices.However, the Department of Energy earlier this month cast a ballot in favor of the conventional wisdom, issuing $18 million in funding for solar energy and storage research for utilities (ClimateWire, Jan. 20).Representatives from the Edison Electric Institute and Electric Power Research Institute did not respond to requests for comment, citing weather-related office closures.MacDonald and Clack said the key enabler for their high renewable energy penetration scenarios is high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission. Photovoltaics and wind turbines often generate direct-current electricity, so transmitting in direct current removes a conversion step that costs money and saps power.HVDC transmission lines also have fewer losses over long distances than alternating-current transmission. The authors envision an HVDC network across the United States akin to the interstate highway system, shunting power from where it\u2019s produced to where it\u2019s needed in a national electricity market.In the model, transmission made up 4 percent of final electricity costs.The study joins a growing suite of work finding that high renewable energy penetration is feasible in the United States (ClimateWire, June 10, 2015). Other studies have also found that energy storage isn\u2019t the gatekeeper for drastically more wind and solar power on the grid (ClimateWire, Sept. 28, 2015).MacDonald said this study is unique because it isn\u2019t betting on a technology breakthrough and it sets its sights on 2030, while other studies set 2050 as the finish line.\u201cWe\u2019ll have doubled the CO2 by then in the air,\u201d he said.Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from Environment & Energy Publishing, LLC.\u00a0www.eenews.net, 202-628-6500Maddie BenderDeboki ChakravartiMaia Szalavitz | OpinionAnna GoshuaKatarina ZimmerMeghan Bartels and SPACE.comDiscover world-changing science.
