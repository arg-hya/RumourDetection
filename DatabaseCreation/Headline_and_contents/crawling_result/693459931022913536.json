It was conceived as exactly that, a return to their rock roots in a desperate effort to restore unity when business and personal chaos threatened to destroy the band. A documentary crew filmed the Beatles rehearsing and recording new material for an \u201chonest\u201d album, free from the studio wizardry that had dominated their recent work. The experience pushed the group to the point of disintegration, but they needed an end to the film.So 47 years ago \u2014 on January 30th, 1969 \u2014 the band climbed five stories to the top of their Apple Corps headquarters and played their last concert together. The album and film were ultimately released in May 1970 as Let It Be, their swan song. Here are 15 little-known facts about the Beatles\u2019 final bow on the world stage.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSee Also\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRingo Starr Announces New 'Change the World' EP\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGo Behind the Scenes With Paul McCartney and Beck on 'Find My Way' Deepfake Video\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSee Also\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlbum Guide: Metallica\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t20 Overlooked Bob Dylan Classics\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThe concert was originally going to take place in an ancient amphitheater. Or on a cruise ship. Or in the desert.The Beatles had many ideas about where to perform the climactic concert for their new film \u2014 too many ideas. London venues like the Palladium and the Roundhouse were some of the more levelheaded propositions, but most were pretty far-out. The Sahara desert was floated as a potential location, as were the Giza pyramids, and even the QE2 ocean liner. A 2,000-year-old Roman amphitheater in Tunisia was seriously considered, and location scouts were sent to investigate. \u201cThe Beatles were to start playing as the sun came up,\u201d explained director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, \u201cand you\u2019d see crowds flocking towards them through the day.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut nothing was ever agreed upon. As enthusiasm for the project waned, the\u00a0band\u00a0opted to do something a little simpler and closer to home. Guest keyboard player Billy Preston recalls that it was John Lennon who had the idea to stage\u00a0the concert on the roof of Apple headquarters. Lindsay-Hogg says it was his idea. Others attribute it to Ringo Starr. The concept sounds inspired, but in retrospect it speaks less to creativity and more to laziness.Preparations were made, with scaffolding planks laid to support the weight of the gear. A few minutes before the concert was due to start, the band huddled in a small vestibule at the top of the stairs. They had cold feet. \u201cGeorge didn\u2019t want to do it, and Ringo started saying he didn\u2019t really see the point,\u201d says Lindsay-Hogg. \u201cThen John said, \u2018Oh, fuck it \u2014 let\u2019s do it.'\u201dJefferson Airplane performed on a New York City rooftop several weeks earlier.The Beatles racked up many firsts over the course of their career, but they were not the first band to hold an unauthorized concert on a metropolitan rooftop. That distinction goes to Jefferson Airplane, who climbed to the top of midtown\u2019s Schuyler Hotel on December 7th, 1968 and surprised the city with cries of \u201cHello, New York! Wake up, you fuckers! Free music! Nice songs! Free love!\u201d Lacking permits, they would only make it through one song \u2014 a blistering version of \u201cThe House at Pooneil Corners\u201d \u2014 before the NYPD threatened arrest for noise disturbance. The band went peacefully, but their friend, actor Rip Torn, was busted for harassing an officer and taken away in a cruiser.Mercifully, the guerrilla happening was preserved for all time by director Jean-Luc Godard, who filmed the incident as part of his One A.M. project. It\u2019s unknown whether the Beatles were directly inspired by the Airplane\u2019s antics, but press coverage (not to mention their friendship with the band) would have likely made them aware of it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film is directed by the secret son of Orson Welles \u2014 allegedly.Having worked with the Beatles on their recent promotional videos for \u201cHey Jude\u201d and \u201cRevolution,\u201d American filmmaker Lindsay-Hogg was the logical choice to direct the Get Back project. He arranged an army of cameras to capture the moment from all angles, sending a crew into the street, the adjacent building, and the Apple reception area \u2014 not to mention the five cameras on the roof itself. The result is some of the most iconic concert footage in history.Film prowess may be in his blood. In his 2011 autobiography, Lindsay-Hogg revealed that he believes himself to be the only son of cinema giant Orson Welles. His mother, actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, publically denied the rampant rumors, but she allegedly acknowledged the truth to family friend Gloria Vanderbilt. When Welles\u2019 oldest daughter supported Lindsay-Hogg\u2019s claim, he submitted to a DNA test. The results were inconclusive.Lennon and Starr\u00a0wore their ladies\u2019 coats.It was 45 degrees in London that raw January afternoon, and that doesn\u2019t account for the icy wind whipping over the West End buildings. Impending fog had ruled out an expensive helicopter aerial shot, and the threat of rain was very real. These conditions were not ideal to making rock and roll. \u201c[My] hands [are] too cold to play the chords,\u201d Lennon muttered between songs, and Apple Corps exec Ken Mansfield held a constant stream of lit cigarettes so George Harrison could warm his fingertips. To ward off the winter chill, Lennon borrowed Yoko Ono\u2019s fur coat (as he did on occasion). Ringo Starr also donned his wife Maureen\u2019s red raincoat.The microphones were wrapped in women\u2019s pantyhose.The cold gusts also proved to be a problem for the delicate studio microphones recording the drums and guitar amplifiers. In need of a quick shield to minimize wind noise, tape engineer (and future Pink Floyd cohort) Alan Parsons was dispatched that morning to buy women\u2019s pantyhose. \u201cI walked into this department store and said, \u2018I need three pairs of pantyhose. It doesn\u2019t matter what size.'\u201d\u00a0he recalled in Guitar Player. \u201cThey thought I was either a bank robber or a cross-dresser.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was their first live performance in over two years.Famously cited as the Beatles\u2019 last concert, the rooftop gig was also their first live performance in more than\u00a0two years. While they had played \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d and \u201cHey Jude\u201d before a studio audience on television during that time, those numbers were heavily bolstered by a backing track. The roof was their first truly live show since their final tour ended on August 29th, 1966, at San Francisco\u2019s Candlestick Park. They also made a small break from tradition by varying their classic stage placements. Lennon took the middle spot with Harrison to his left.George Harrison\u2019s guitar was the first of its kind.The Telecaster that Harrison played throughout the rooftop concert was custom made for him by master builders Roger Rossmeisl and Philip Kubicki as a gift from Fender. The company was launching a new line of all-rosewood guitars, and presenting the prototype to a Beatle was good publicity. After many hours of labor, the guitar was flown to England in its own seat and hand-delivered to Apple headquarters. The builders weren\u2019t sure what became of the guitar for over a year, until they bought tickets to see the Let It Be film and saw their handiwork on the big screen. \u201cI was so thrilled I almost jumped out of my seat,\u201d remembers Kubicki.John Lennon needed cue cards to remember his own lyrics.John Lennon always had a problem with lyrics. Paul McCartney often recalls seeing Lennon onstage singing his own ad-libbed words to the Del Vikings\u2019\u00a0\u201cCome Go With Me\u201d on the day they met in 1957.\u00a0Wanting to get things reasonably correct for the film, the Beatles asked Apple office assistant Kevin Harrington to kneel just out of camera view and hold up a lyric sheet for \u201cDig a\u00a0Pony.\u201d Lennon still managed a memorable flub during \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Down,\u201d singing something like, \u201cAnd only reese we got the blootchy-koo.\u201d\u201cOne After 909 \u201d is one of the earliest Lennon-McCartney compositions the Beatles released.While \u201cI Call Your Name,\u201d \u201cWhat Goes On,\u201d and several others also vie for the title, \u201cOne After 909\u201d is likely the very earliest complete Lennon-McCartney songwriting effort released on an original Beatles album. Lennon claimed that he wrote it when he was 17 years old with a little help from his new friend, Paul McCartney. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great song,\u201d McCartney remembered in later years. \u201cBut it\u2019s a great favorite of mine because it has great memories for me of John and I trying to write a bluesy freight-train song.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band had originally recorded \u201cOne After 909\u201d at EMI Studios during sessions for \u201cFrom Me to You\u201d in March 1963. This version was shelved, but the song was resurrected six years later for the Get Back/Let It Be project \u2014 as a joke more than anything else. The live version from the rooftop concert ended up on Let It Be, giving \u201cOne After 909\u201d its long-awaited public debut on the last album they issued.There were other songs performed on the rooftop that day.\u00a0While 21 minutes of the concert made it into the final Let It Be film, the actual performance was twice as long. During the 42-minute set, the Beatles played \u201cOne After 909,\u201d two complete versions each of \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Down,\u201d \u201cDig a\u00a0Pony\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve Got a\u00a0Feeling,\u201d and three versions of \u201cGet Back\u201d \u2014 plus various incomplete takes, including a line from the Irish folk song \u201cDanny Boy.\u201dIn addition to these, the band tossed off snippets of several songs that didn\u2019t make the cut for Let It Be. These include a few bars of \u201cI Want You,\u201d later released on Abbey Road, and lines from the Irving Berlin chestnut \u201cA Pretty Girl Is Like a\u00a0Melody.\u201d The most complete of these off-the-cuff performances is an instrumental version of \u201cGod Save the Queen,\u201d played while engineer Alan Parsons changed tape reels. These were little more than jokes, and were never seriously considered for any official release.The police weren\u2019t as bad as they\u2019ve been made out to be.Beatles lore portrays the London Metropolitan Police as the prototypical blue meanies who forcibly halted one of the greatest musical moments of the 1960s. To a certain extent, this is true. But the bobbies actually cut the band some slack \u2014 and did them a serious solid.The West End Central Police Station is located at 27 Savile Row \u2014 mere feet from Apple headquarters. The authorities obviously must have heard the loud rock music wafting down the street. Windows rattled, floors shook, and horns blared from the resulting traffic jams. If they wanted to, the police could have walked over and shut things down before the first song was over. Instead, they let the concert continue for 42 minutes. It was only when the noise complaints began to flood in from stuffy local businesses that they felt compelled to act. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven then, they gave the Beatles and Co. ample warning to get rid of certain illicit substances that might have been on the scene. \u201cBefore the raid, someone called from the Savile Row police station saying, \u2018You\u2019ve got 10 minutes.'\u201d recalled one Apple employee. \u201cSo we knew they were coming and everyone was ready for it. \u2026\u00a0When the police raided the building, there was a whole chorus of toilets being flushed.\u201d Crisis averted.The set list may have ended up being longer.Because the concert was cut short by the police, fans have spent decades theorizing what other songs \u2014 if any \u2014 the Beatles might have performed had they continued. Some eagle-eyed rock scholars have noticed equipment in the background of the Apple roof set that went unused, including an extra keyboard, a lap-steel guitar and what appears to be an acoustic-guitar microphone positioned by McCartney. Were folky songs like \u201cTwo of Us\u201d originally in the mix? Was McCartney going to try out some of his piano-based ballads like \u201cLet It Be\u201d and \u201cThe Long and Winding Road\u201d? Could Lennon have used the lap-steel guitar as he did on \u201cFor You Blue,\u201d giving Harrison his first (and only) solo vocal of the day?It\u2019s hard to know for certain. Some fans believe Harrison asked that his songs not be played on the roof that day. Others argue that these quieter numbers would have been impossible to record in the windy and uncontrolled setting. It also seems unlikely that the Beatles would have repeated so many songs if they also intended to perform others. But why the extra instruments? Perhaps the band\u2019s roadies received vague instructions to bring their equipment up to the roof, and simply grabbed everything they could find. To date, no set list has ever been found.Billy Preston received the only official Beatles co-credit.Friends with the Beatles since touring Europe with Little Richard in 1962, Billy Preston is the MVP of the entire Get Back/Let It Be project. Band relations had deteriorated so badly that Harrison actually walked out on the sessions, vowing to quit the group all together. To clear his head, he attended a Ray Charles concert, where Preston happened to be playing organ. Harrison invited him back to the studio to jam with the rest of the Beatles. His warm nature soothed tensions and his keyboard chops added a dose of excitement to the formerly dreary proceedings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreston\u2019s sparking musical contribution on Let It Be speaks for itself. Lennon even lobbied to make Preston a full member of the band \u2014 an actual fifth Beatle. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough with four!\u201d McCartney supposedly replied. Even so, his importance was recognized on the single release of \u201cGet Back,\u201d which is credited to \u201cThe Beatles with Billy Preston.\u201d Barring unauthorized reissues, it was the first time that the Beatles credited anyone on their records in this way.Preston would go on to record with the Beatles on Abbey Road that summer, laying down keyboard parts on \u201cI Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy)\u201d and \u201cSomething.\u201dThe site of the rooftop concert is now a children\u2019s Abercrombie &\u00a0Fitch.The Beatles purchased 3 Savile Row in 1968 as the headquarters for Apple Corps. They constructed a studio in the basement, which they used to record the second half of their Get Back/Let It Be sessions. Harry Nilsson, Badfinger, Marc Bolan and others also recorded there before Apple sold the building in 1976. It changed hands a number of times over the years until it was purchased by Abercrombie & Fitch in 2012. A children\u2019s clothing store currently resides in the building\u2019s ground floor \u2014 throwing\u00a0London tailors, historians and Beatle fans into an uproar.It\u2019s the last sound you hear on the Beatles\u2019 final release.Although Abbey Road was the final album to be recorded by the four Beatles, Let It Be was the last to be issued in May 1970, weeks after the group\u2019s split made headlines around the world. The black-trimmed cover gave it funereal quality, and fans anxiously studied to the parting message from the foursome that defined the Sixties.As \u201cGet Back,\u201d the last track, draws to a close, the sound of John Lennon\u2019s voice can be heard: \u201cI\u2019d like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition.\u201d It was a self-effacing remark made at the end of the rooftop show, poking fun at the many auditions the band failed over the years. It was also a humble nod to the band\u2019s unprecedented success\u00a0\u2014 and,\u00a0inadvertently, the perfect Beatles epitaph.\u00a0\n\t\tIn This Article:\n\t\t\t\tGeorge Harrison,\t\t\t\tJohn Lennon,\t\t\t\tPaul McCartney,\t\t\t\tRingo Starr,\t\t\t\tThe Beatles \n\t\t\tWant more Rolling Stone?
