Snape in Harry Potter, Hans Gruber in Die Hard, Alexander Dane in Galaxy Quest\u2014everyone\u2019s done an impression of at least one of his roles. \u201cBy Grabthar\u2019s hammer, by the suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged!\u201d is going to be said a lot today.While Rickman\u2019s filmography is as varied as one can get\u2014comedies like Dogma, romance in Sense and Sensibility, adventure in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\u2014his villains loom large in pop culture. 1988's Die Hard ensured that, as he set a new standard for intelligent and urbane villains that even that franchise was never able to recreate. The meeting between Gruber and Bruce Willis\u2019 John McClane was added to the film because of Rickman\u2019s ability to do an American accent. For the next generation of film goers, Rickman\u2019s mark is as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films. He was J.K. Rowling\u2019s personal pick for the role and he was one of the select few who she talked to about the direction the books would go in. Before the fans got to read about it, Rickman was already playing Snape\u2019s motivation.If a character was, at least on paper, a criminal or unpleasant or mean or evil, Rickman\u2019s performances also made them the stars. Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves isn\u2019t a good movie at all, but Rickman\u2019s Sheriff of Nottingham is delightfully twisted.Despite the perception that he was always a baddie, Rickman never saw it that way. On QI, John Sessions told a story of a child asking Rickman why he always played villains. To which Rickman reportedly responded, \u201cI don\u2019t play villains, I play very interesting people.\u201dHe did. He played funny people, angry people, people in love, people in pain. He played everything under the sun and it still seems like we didn\u2019t get enough. Image credit: Warner Bros. Contact the author at katharine@io9.com.Well, the 2016th season of Earth sucks so far. I don\u2019t get why the writers have to kill off so many loveable characters. "}
