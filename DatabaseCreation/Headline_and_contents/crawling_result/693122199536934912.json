It showed 45.2 percent believed Merkel\u2019s refugee policy was not a reason for her to resign. It was the first time the pollster had asked voters whether Merkel should quit.Related CoverageAnother poll released on Friday, by the Elector Research Group, showed support for Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc steady at 37 percent. As recently as September, they were on 42 percent. Support for the SPD was also unchanged, at 24 percent.The poll put the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), which supports a hard line on immigration, on 11 percent.The three ruling parties - Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, their Bavarian allies, and the SPD - are eager to show voters that the government is in control of the refugee crisis before three state votes in March and a general election next year.A dispute over tighter immigration rules has nonetheless been straining the ruling coalition.Merkel has also faced criticism from other European Union countries for her stance on migration, including from Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who she meets later on Friday.Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by Noah BarkinOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
