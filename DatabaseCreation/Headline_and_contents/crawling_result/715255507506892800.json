When continually pressed for what the answer is regarding punishing women who would break any theoretical ban, Trump said the \u201canswer is that there has to be some form of punishment, yeah.\u201dLater in the day, his campaign released a statement refocusing who would be punished should abortion become illegal. \u201cIf Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed \u2014 like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.\u201dWhen asked what kind of punishment he had in mind, Trump lacked specifics and said that he has \u201cnot determined what the punishment would be.\u201d Trump noted that he does \u201ctake positions on everything else, but this is a very complicated position.\"\u201cIf you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under the law,\u201d Matthews stated, making the pivot from the moral position of being pro-life to the practical implications of implementing that position in the law.Trump asked Matthews, \u201care you going to say, well wait, are you going to say put them in jail? Is that the punishment you\u2019re talking about?\u201dMatthews responded that that\u2019s the question he was asking the front-runner himself. Trump responded that he was pro-life.The MSNBC host followed up wondering if a man should bear responsibility for abortions as well, to which Trump said \u201cno,\u201d he didn\u2019t think so.Trump asked repeatedly about the Catholic church\u2019s position on abortion, at multiple points trying to turn the questions on the interviewer himself in relation to how he squared the moral position of the church with the real life implications.Related: Explaining Trump's Problem With Female VotersShould the United States change the law of the land on abortion as set by the landmark SCOTUS ruling Roe vs Wade Trump said, \u201cyou\u2019ll go back to a position like they had where people will, perhaps, go to illegal places.\u201d Still, he maintains \u201cyou have to ban it.\u201dOhio Republican John Kasich, who participated in an MSNBC town hall moderated by NBC's Chuck Todd earlier in the day, was asked if he agreed with Trump on the prospect of punishing women for abortion. \"Absolutely not,\" Kasich responded. \"I do have exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother but of course women shouldn\u2019t be punished,\" he added.In Wednesday's town hall meeting, Trump also continued the defense of his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, saying that he didn\u2019t think an initial apology from his campaign manager would\u2019ve changed the current situation.\u201cI think if he called up to apologize I think we\u2019d be in the exact same place,\u201d he told Matthews, wondering if Lewandowski may have even apologized in the moment. \u201cThey\u2019re destroying a very good person\u2026over nothing\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good person with a wonderful family.\"Trump called the incident in question \u201cso minor\" before continuing to discredit former Brietbart reporter Michelle Fields by attacking the premise of her story. \u201cWhat\u2019s contact?\u201d he hedged, noting that her facial expression didn\u2019t change despite saying she was almost pulled to the ground by Lewandowski. Trump later added that he was \u201cskeptical\u201d about her.Related: Trump on Campaign Manager -- \"I Can't Destroy a Man.\"The GOP front-runner says \u201cnobody respects women\u201d more than he does. That respect, however, doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to Fields. \u201cI would say I don\u2019t have great respect for her,\u201d Trump told Matthews. He also dodged when asked why he didn\u2019t have sympathy for Fields, instead pointing out that the tape being used by the police investigation was his tape and saying that there are more pressing issues at play, like ISIS and foreign threats.As he\u2019s said before, Trump alleged that Fields touched him twice and questioned if he should even go so far as to press charges against her. He once again posited that she was breaking the rules as the press conference was over and she was still trying to ask questions by dogging him as he left the room.Trump also called out the Jupiter Police, saying that \u201cwhat they\u2019ve done is, I think, outrageous.Ali Vitali is a political reporter for NBC News, based in Washington.\u00a9\u00a02021 NBC UNIVERSAL"}
