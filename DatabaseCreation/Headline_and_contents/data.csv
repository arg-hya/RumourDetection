20,SC Senator: Women Are “A Lesser Cut Of Meat”,"PublishedonBy|| By FITSNEWS ||  A discussion over a pending criminal domestic violence (CDV) bill took a bizarre turn this week when S.C. Senator Thomas Corbin – a “Republican” from Travelers Rest, S.C. – offered some bizarrely sexist commentary on the role of women in the political process.Corbin’s comments – made at a legislative dinner held in downtown Columbia, S.C. – were reportedly directed at S.C. Senator Katrina Shealy, the only female member of the 46-person State Senate.According to multiple witnesses who attended the dinner – held at Cowboy Brazilian Steakhouse on Main Street (a few blocks from the S.C. State House)  -Senate judiciary committee members were discussing the CDV issue, which has been a source of several previous headaches for the GOP.That’s when Corbin – no stranger to making bizarre statements –  is said to have begun needling his lone female colleague regarding her gender.“I see it only took me two years to get you wearing shoes,” Corbin told Shealy, who was elected in 2012 as a petition candidate.Wait … what?By way of explanation, lawmakers and legislative staffers have previously told FITS about statements made by Corbin – statements reflecting his belief that women do not belong in the S.C. General Assembly and should instead be “at home baking cookies” or “barefoot and pregnant.”“He makes comments like that all the time to everybody – including Senator Shealy,” one Senate staffer told FITS.Corbin’s latest comments took his sexism to a whole new level, though.At one point in the conversation – which quickly escalated into a confrontation – Shealy is said to have angrily asked Corbin where he “got off” attacking women.His response – overheard by numerous lobbyists and fellow lawmakers – was one for the ages.“Well, you know God created man first,” Corbin said, reportedly smirking at Shealy.  “Then he took the rib out of man to make woman.  And you know, a rib is a lesser cut of meat.”Ummmm …  wow.Calls to Corbin’s office were not immediately returned, but sources close to the 50-year-old  lawmaker tell FITS his comments were part of a “running joke” between him and Shealy.“He’s just needling her – he don’t mean nothing by it,” the source said.KATRINA SHEALYShealy declined to discuss the matter with FITS – citing its irrelevance to the legislative matter under discussion – but sources at the event tell FITS Corbin did not appear to be joking.  Furthermore, they added that if there really was a “running joke,” Shealy clearly wasn’t in on it.“She got in his face,” one lobbyist who attended the event said of Shealy’s reaction, adding that at one point “we thought we were going to have to hold her back.”Wow … good for her.Shealy has been an incredibly substantive, consistently pro-free market reformer ever since she defeated former S.C. Sen. Jakie Knotts – a fiscally liberal,  “Republican” – in 2012.  She’s taken principled stands for taxpayers – and even taken on her former ally governor Nikki Haley when she thought it was right.We like her  … not because she’s a woman, but because she’s a solid Senator who is strong on the issues that ought to matter to Palmetto State citizens.As for Corbin?  He’s got a decent voting record, but the first-term lawmaker continues to marginalize himself by saying ridiculous things in public.Maybe he’s joking, maybe he isn’t … and he’s obviously got a right to speak his mind like the rest of us … but Corbin needs to recognize right quickly that the fight for expanded individual liberty and economic prosperity is (and always should be) blind to questions of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other determining characteristic that’s got nothing to do with a person’s views on the issues.Otherwise he will continue to be nothing but a sideshow at the S.C. State House … one with a serious problem heading into the 2016 election cycle.@fitsnews Gee, I wonder off the top of my head, if I could discern his political affiliation.— Darth Skeptic (@weakSquare) February 11, 2015@fitsnews I thought for a moment there that Will was bucking for Jon Stewart's job… But it's apparently for real…— Brad Warthen (@BradWarthen) February 11, 2015@weakSquare @fitsnews This is why we can't have nice things in SC.— George R.

42,Chick-fil-A Manager Bans 'Unprofessional' Teen Slang,"Filed under:Banned words include ""bae,"" ""turn up,"" and ""ratchet."" Eric, the manager of a Chick-fil-A is allegedly feeling extra ""salty"" about the slang his millennial employees have been dropping. According to a post on Reddit, management at an undisclosed location of the  chain will not tolerate any talk of an employee's ""bae"" or or their attempts to ""turn up"" when making chicken and waffles and ""speciality grade"" coffee. Other terms not to be uttered include ""cuz"" regardless of whether they are referring to their cousin or using it in place of ""because,"" ""ratchet,"" and ""3Hunnid.""The manager sternly explains his banned word list at the bottom of the note:""You are a professional so speak professionally."" He isn't joking around: One employee attempted to scratch out a banned term. Eric responded with a threatening hand-written note stating that staff will lose their employee meals if they scratch words out.Gawker points out that even if is this just a hoax, the person behind it has ""captured the poetry of an aggrieved fast food manager perfectly."" Eater has reached out to Chick-fil-A for comment, but until then, someone needs to tell Eric to chill cuz it will all be okay. See the list below:

47,"Alaskan Reporter Says ""F*ck This,"" Quits on Live TV in Marijuana Legalization Protest","
		We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we love. Promise.

			Reporter Charlo Greene quit on live TV during a broadcast last night on KTVA in Anchorage, Alaska. She helmed a segment, her very last segment, on the Alaska Cannabis Club last night, which is apparently the state's only medical marijuana resource. Its website adds that its business model ""finds a perfect balancing act with Alaska's Medical Marijuana laws, Alaska's constitutional protections and current local and state marijuana laws factored in."" In other words, it acts as a go-between.And it turns out Greene is the club's CEO — a fact she had apparently not disclosed in any pre-show reporting [via Dazed & Confused]. As the cameras rolled, she outed herself, saying she plans to ""[dedicate] all my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska."" ""And as for this job,"" she continued, noticeably nervous and a little emotional, ""not that I have a choice, but fuck it – I quit."" Greene then walked off camera, and that was that. The camera quickly panned to a rather flabbergasted anchor who apologized for the profanity, and cut to a commercial.The Alaska Cannabis Club's Facebook page had prompted its followers to tune in for the show, though apparently no one knew of Greene's dramatic plans. (It's worth noting her phrasing — ""not that I have a choice"" — suggests her resignation may have been preceded at least by some newsroom politics/unpleasantness.) She has now launched an Indiegogo fundraising page to raise money, and awareness, for her cause. There, she writes:As a member of the media, I've seen the dirty campaign tricks and lies that prohibitionists have been using over the past several months to sway Alaskan voters firsthand. Here's the sad thing: it's working. Polling shows the majority of Alaskans, who were in favor of the initiative at the start of the year, are now against it.Few people fighting for marijuana legalization in Alaska are as media savvy, well educated on the marijuana industry, passionate, professional and completely dedicated to passing this initiative as me, the only person in Alaska that has had the balls to face the injustice of Alaska's medical marijuana catch-22 and do something about it. My Alaska Cannabis Club members are right here with me, ready to fight this long overdue fight.Also, the Club's logo is an igloo with a marijuana leaf inside.Follow Alex on Twitter.",1590194,2477,14851,594,130,3347,"1"

66,Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,"Photo via Flickr user Cristina Kirchner Last week, President Cristina Kirchner adopted a Jewish teenager named Yair Tawil and posted pictures of the event on her Twitter feed. Outlets around the world ran with the story, explaining the move by citing lingering local superstition about werewolves. In Western folklore, only a werewolf can create another werewolf with its bite, but in Argentina, the story's a little different: the creature is born when a couple gives birth to their seventh son in a row. According to said folklore, seventh sons turn into el lobizon on their 13th birthday if nothing is done about the hereditary curse. Thus, the need for presidential action is pretty clear.""The notion of animal shifting came from different Native American traditions,"" Oscar Chamosa, a folklorist at the University of Georgia, told me. ""The idea of el lobison comes from uturunco—or the were-jaguar—which mixed with the European notion of the werewolf."" Chamosa says he's not sure how the idea was first associated with teenaged boys.But even if someone who's devoted his entire life to studying Argentine folklore can't explain it, the teen werewolf thing had become pervasive by the early 20th century, and Catholics in Argentina were producing enough seventh children, that the myth became a public policy problem. After all, terrified parents were (according to legend, at least) regularly committing infanticide.""In order to counteract the myth, Argentine presidents have traditionally godfathered any child born into the same family,"" Chamosa explains, adding that the governor of a province or mayor of a village would sometimes officiate for practical reasons. ""The rationale is that the godson of a president would be respected throughout his life despite the suspicion his seventh-male birth position would bring with it.""This idea apparently prevented people from murdering their own babies, so it was a smart move on part of the Argentine government. But if it's surprising people believed in such a curse a century ago, it's downright bizarre that they're still entertaining the notion of it today.As per a decree that came out in 1973, adoptees receive a gold medal and a college scholarship. And Argentina is apparently still making new rules about werewolf children, because in 1999 the adoption ceremony was extended to non-Catholics. As the Independent noted, Tawil is the first Jewish boy to receive the honor. So while a werewolf Bar Mitzvah might be a joke on 30 Rock, it's also apparently a real thing that just happened in South America.The boy's parents first applied for the medal and scholarship in 1993, but were denied. They applied again after the rules changed to include Jews in 2009. A tweet from President Kirchner's account shows her lighting a menorah with the Tawils, quite the gesture given that the Jewish population of Argentina is less than half of one percent.Jewishpublications are making a big deal out of the historic event, and angry commenters are freaking out about a Jew being adopted—even symbolically—by a non-Jew and the blasphemous concept of a Jewish family taking part in something involving werewolves. (In Jewish folklore, people don't turn into werewolves, and whatever they were before beasthood is never really discussed.)But most observers have been glossing over the absolutely fucking strange juxtaposition between a groundbreaking event and an ancient superstition. Like, for instance, that's it's kind of a weird move to progressively bequeath a privilege to a religious minority while tacitly legitimizing the belief that human beings have the ability to transform into mythical creatures that feast on unbaptized babies.Stories about the adoption would also have us believe the president of an industrialized nation believes in werewolves, which is clearly not the case. Although presidents in our own country's recent memory believed they were chosen by God, Chamosa describes Argentina's Kirchner as a nominal Catholic who's a ""progressive left-wing president—more like a Marxist and a secular person in general."" Much as our Dear Leader pardons a turkey every year, this is an Argentine ritual that's basically a national inside joke.Chamosa says that the werewolf thing has stuck around out of quaint tradition and that the average family in the country today has only two children. For that reason, anyone who achieves an unbroken chain of seven same-sex children is rewarded with the prize.Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't some people in Latin America who still believe in el lobizon.""Belief in the healing powers of folk saints and withcraft are pretty much shared across the territory, especially—but not only—in rural areas,"" Chamosa says. ""I would say that only old people still believe [in el lobison]. But you really don't know.""Follow Allie Conti on Twitter.",2038759,10769,23215,876,87,2512,"0"
67,"Hewlett-Packard Confirms Plans To Split In Two, Cut An Additional 5,000 Jobs","Computer and printing giant Hewlett-Packard said Monday morning that it plans to split into two separate publicly traded companies, confirming the speculation that broke out over the weekend. The company also confirmed its plan to cut another 5,000 jobs and pledged to invest the money saved from the lower headcount into research and development. Wall Street is cheering the news, sending the stock for a more-than 5% gain in early Monday trading.By the end of 2015, the HP of today will no longer exist; the tech giant will split itself into one company focused on servers, software and cloud technology, and one company focusing on the legacy computers and printers business. The cloud-focused company, to be named Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, will be led by current CEO Meg Whitman; the computer-and-printer-focused business will be named HP Inc and led by Dion Weisler, who is currently serving as executive vice president of HP's printing and personal systems business. Whitman will serve as non-executive chairman of HP Inc's board of directors.HP Inc will retain HP's existing logo, the company said, and current HP shareholders will own shares of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc once the split is complete. (The transaction should be tax-free for federal income tax purposes, HP noted.)""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan. It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders,"" Whitman said in a statement Monday morning. ""In short, by transitioning now from one HP to two new companies, created out of our successful turnaround efforts, we will be in an even better position to compete in the market, support our customers and partners, and deliver maximum value to our shareholders.""As Hewlett-Packard Enterprise focuses on developing cloud services, HP Inc will focus its efforts and investments on developments in computing and 3-D printing.""This is a defining moment in our industry as customers are looking for innovation to enable workforces that are more mobile, connected and productive while at the same time allowing a seamless experience across work and play,"" Weisler said in a statement Monday morning, adding that HP Inc is positioned to do just that.In the statement confirming the impending split, HP also reaffirmed its financial outlook for full-year 2014 results, saying that it expects to record non-GAAP earnings between $3.70 and $3.74 per share. For fiscal 2015, HP is projecting full-year non-GAAP earnings per share between 3.83 and $4.03. Neither outlook includes the one-time charges that the company expects to incur from the separation of businesses.""HP’s balance sheet is in the strongest shape it has been in the past several years with cash greater than debt, PC margins are very stable, and services margins are improving,"" wrote Citi analyst Jim Suva in a research note Monday morning. Suva has HP rated as a buy with a $40 price target, but said that break-up could provide additional upside to the stock price. ""This allows the company more financial flexibility. We also note the stock market has been embracing spin outs with recent news from eBay (spin out PayPay), etc,"" Suva said.In an investor presentation on its website, HP also provided shareholders with an update on its restructuring plans: in addition to the previously-announced 45,000 to 50,000 total employee reductions, HP will cut another 5,000 jobs. By the time the restructuring program is complete, HP will have cut its headcount by 55,000 positions.Shares of HP soared in Monday's pre-market trading session on the confirmation of the separation plans and job cuts; the stock was up more than 5% as the opening bell approached. Year-to-date, shares have gained more than 27%.Maggie McGrath is  the editor of ForbesWomen, the Forbes vertical dedicated to covering all angles of female entrepreneurship.

        The South American Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) is the world's largest spider, according to Guinness World Records. Its legs can reach up to one foot and it can weight up to 6 oz.. (Piotr Naskrecki)Piotr Naskrecki was taking a nighttime walk in a rainforest in Guyana, when he heard rustling as if something were creeping underfoot. When he turned on his flashlight, he expected to see a small mammal, such as a possum or a rat.""When I turned on the light, I couldn't quite understand what I was seeing,"" said Naskrecki, an entomologist and photographer at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology.A moment later, he realized he was looking not at a brown, furry mammal, but an enormous, puppy-size spider.Known as the South American Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), the colossal arachnid is the world's largest spider, according to Guinness World Records. Itsleg span can reach up to a foot (30 centimeters), or about the size of ""a child's forearm,"" with a body the size of ""a large fist,"" Naskrecki told Live Science. And the spider can weigh more than 6 oz., about as much as a young puppy, the scientist wrote on his blog. [See Photos of the Goliath Birdeater Spider]Some sources say the giant huntsman spider, which has a larger leg span, is bigger than the birdeater. But the huntsman is much more delicate than the hefty birdeater comparing the two would be ""like comparing a giraffe to an elephant,"" Naskrecki said.The birdeater's enormity is evident from the sounds it makes. ""Its feet have hardened tips and claws that produce a very distinct, clicking sound, not unlike that of a horse's hooves hitting the ground,"" he wrote, but ""not as loud.""Prickly hairs and 2-inch fangsWhen Naskrecki approached the imposing creature in the rainforest, it would rub its hind legs against its abdomen. At first, the scientist thought the behavior was ""cute,"" he said, but then he realized the spider was sending out a cloud of hairs with microscopic barbs on them. When these hairs get in the eyes or other mucous membranes, they are ""extremely painful and itchy,"" and can stay there for days, he said. [Creepy-Crawly Gallery: See Spooky Photos of Spiders]But its prickly hairs aren't the birdeater's only line of defense; it also sports a pair of 2-inch-long  fangs. Although the spider's bite is venomous, it's not deadly to humans. But it would still be extremely painful, ""like driving a nail through your hand,"" Naskrecki said.And the eight-legged beast has a third defense mechanism up its hairy sleeve. The hairs on the front of the spider's body have tiny hooks and barbs that make a hissing sound when they rub against each other, ""sort of like pulling Velcro apart,"" Naskrecki said.Yet despite all that, the spider doesn't pose a threat to humans. Even if it bites you, ""a chicken can probably do more damage,"" Naskrecki said.Bird eater or mostly harmless?Despite its name, the birdeater doesn't usually eat birds, although it is certainly capable of killing small mammals. ""They will essentially attack anything that they encounter,"" Naskrecki said.The spider hunts in leaf litter on the ground at night, so the chances of it encountering a bird are very small, he said. However, if it found a nest, it could easily kill the parents and the chicks, he said, adding that the spider species has also been known to puncture and drink bird eggs.The spider will eat frogs and insects, but its main prey is actually earthworms, which come out at night when it's humid. ""Earthworms are very nutritious,"" Naskrecki said.Birdeaters are not very common spiders. ""I've been working in the tropics in South America for many, many years, and in the last 10 to 15 years, I only ran across the spider three times,"" Naskrecki.After catching the specimen he found in Guyana, which was female, Naskrecki took her back to his lab to study. She's now deposited in a museum.Copyright 2014 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company. All rights reserved.

Mark-1 absolutely, definitely does not service your area.A picture posted on Twitter by the Supporters of the Religion Front — a faction engaged in the ongoing Syrian civil war — shows an enormous gun mounted to the back of a Ford F-250 decorated with the name and number of Mark-1, a plumbing operation in Texas City, Texas. Mark-1 is known better for unclogging toilets than fighting brutal, drawn-out conflicts in the Middle East.It's no laughing matterAs bizarre as it is, it's no laughing matter: as the picture has spread on social media, KHOU reports that Mark-1 has received angry phone calls from individuals wondering why they're supporting a bloody war worlds away. The company traded in the truck last year, which ended up going to auction; fast forward a few months, and the vehicle — Mark-1's contact information and all — somehow shows up in Syria, modified to create problems rather than solve them.Always remove your phone number from your truck before you sell it.Subscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.Check your inbox for a welcome email.",2828417,170,25068,889,263,15322,"1"

97,This is the surface-to-air missile that Ukraine says shot down MH17,"This article is more than 1 year oldReports of a crashed Malaysian airliner are still coming in — follow the Washington Post's liveblog here — but there are already suggestions that MH17, which lost contact with officials near the Russia-Ukraine border, was shot down by surface-to-air missile.According to flight data, the aircraft was flying at altitude just before the crash, at roughly 33,000 feet.To take down a plane at these heights would require an advanced air defense system; the Ukrainian Interior Ministry says the separatists who fired the shot were armed with a Russian-made Buk missile launcher.The Buk, also known as the SA-11, is a medium-range mobile missile platform that can engage targets flying at altitudes well above MH17's last reported figures — by some estimates, as much as 72,000 feet. Newer versions of the Buk are known as the SA-17; here's a video of one in action.Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Andrei Lysenko told Interfax Thursday that the Ukrainian army is not equipped with the SA-11, which raises questions about where the separatists may have gotten one (if that's in fact what they used). For their part, rebel leaders deny having any Buk missile launchers. But other militia members told Russian state media last month that they had ""taken control"" of a number of SA-11s.Another possibility? Man Portable Air Defense Systems, or MANPADS. These are lighter and can be carried by a single person. In fact, separatists have been using shoulder-fired missiles for weeks to shoot down other aircraft, according to aviation specialist David Cenciotti. But even the most advanced MANPADS have a limited ceiling compared to bigger missile platforms. The SA-18, which the separatists have reportedly used before, has a maximum altitude of 11,000 feet.On top of the plane crash itself, it appears we now have a puzzle concerning the provenance of the weapons that caused it.Update: U.S. officials have confirmed that MH17 was downed by a surface-to-air missile, according to The Post's own Ernesto Londoño.Have more to say about this topic?

The musk has been used in traditional medicines and perfumes for centuries. This particular species is now endangered as a result of intense poaching and habitat loss, and the last time a scientific team spotted one was back in 1948.In an Oct. 22 edition of the journal Oryx, Wildlife Conservation Society researchers reported five sightings. They saw one lone male in the same area three times, one female with a child, and one solitary female -- which may have been the same deer without her young. The researchers report that the deer were difficult to spot, and couldn't be photographed.The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy",18209828,1719,43833,1341,172,6205,"1"

News has confirmed that that is not the truth!A rep for the Irish hunk tells us, ""All press reports are pure conjecture as the studio has not committed to a sequel as yet.""Australian magazine NW reported that Dornan decided to quit the series, which has seen phenomenal success in the box office, because his wife, Amelia Warner, was allegedly uncomfortable with the BDSM material.But after the false claims spread, fans took to Twitter to express their outrage, not only at Dornan but also his wife. WATCH: Dakota Johnson reveals what she stole from the set of Fifty Shades of GreyAlthough the studio ""has not committed"" to a follow up to the first movie (author E.L. James wrote three installments), actress Eloise Mumford, who plays Anastasia Steele's roommate in the movie, told E!

Finally!Make sure to charge TEPCO when it is over!!Just now!?wait wait, use more public funds! Tepco just posted a profit the other week after raising their rates, they need to use their own money!The government should spend what is necessary to get the situation under control, then take the money from TEPCO.So the first thing they do is ask for money, before they even know what ""measures"" to take! Looks like METI have spotted a potentially large trough to dine from...Sending more ""volunteers"" and buckets would be my guess.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has ordered the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which regulates TEPCO and other power utilities, to significantly step up its role.Actually, METI is the problem. On March 11, 2011, when the earthquake occurred, all the METI nuclear inspectors evacuated Fukushima Daiich Nuclear Power plant, leaving everything to TEPCO. That evacuation lead to communication breakdown between the power plant and the government headquarters. Their evacuation is recorded in government report of the nuclear accident, but so far none of them were punished.I have to watch closely what METI will do with the budget. Chances are that they would use the money for something else.maybe the could find a Peter like the dutch did and he can put his hand in the dyke and save everyone.!!closing the door after the horse bolted..Need to raise taxes? Release more radioactive water...Well, better late than never, I suppose! It would have been nice if the previous prime ministers did the same. He is the third since the disaster, I think. It's hard to keep track of them. Let's see if he has the courage of his convictions and follows through with this order or if it is just another round of political grandstanding to please the masses. Seriously though, somebody should be held accountable for the farce that is going on there. They are openly admitting they have been pumping radioactive water into the ocean and leaking it into the surrounding environment and also admit they have withheld this information for fear of reprisal. Is that not a criminal act in this country? Or, is TEPCO above the law? I couldn't get away with such lies and deception, so I see no reason why TEPCO should be able to!There seems no idea no plan to contain catastrophic contamination....Y40bil is not a problem when Abe is in-chage- of Abenomics !Just remember :http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/govt-suggests-tepco-freeze-soil-around-fukushima-plantTEPCO officials promised to study the plan but said the cost of installing such a system would be high. It also said it would take SEVERAL YEARS to implement.But... no problem give us $400 million now, and we'll see in several years....TEPCO is trying to prevent groundwater from reaching the plant by building a ""bypass"", but recent spikes of radioactive elements in sea water has prompted the utility to reverse months of denials and finally admit that tainted water is reaching the sea.If the spike is recent, the leak is recent.  Accusing ""months of denials"" is illogical.The government can do nothing. Tepco Is a part of the government.The way  Fukushima has been handled is an embarrassment to Japan and the Japanese people. Japans livelihood depends on the pacific ocean. Until the Japanese people truly feel threatened by the Nuclear fallout in the air they breathe,the food they eat,the clothes they wear and so on,nothing will ever change. Please world come together and clean up this mess.Cart, horse, too little too late but give it a go.The Japanese government and TEPCO even the regulators are all cohorts.Those guys at the METI and Govt are distributing cakes of half of billion $ , one after one, to TEPCO which is posting profit,  like if they had no limit pumping in our pocket....geez this is money we are all making from our hard work and the salary of our health, really that makes you want to have no job just to not be collectively part of that crazy system. TEPCO must pay for the cleaning cost and if not enough money (which I doubt looking at their total assets)  go and collect money from their friends Hitachi and Toshiba.40 years at a cost of 11 billion! Yeah right, try 40 years at a cost 200 billion!!Only took them 2 1/2 years to admit the water is leaking into the ocean...that is most "" unfortunate"".
The ministry official also said the government plans to reduce the leakage amount to 60 tons per day by as early as December.This reminds me very much to the safety conditions in the simpson's nuclear powerplant with homer as safety inspector. look out for 3 eyed fish when you go shopping ;)I know you should set realistic goals, but 60tonnes a day?
Quite an achievement.................Interesting JT just changed the headlines to this article,  something about how Abe has finally decided to get the government involved with this disaster. The headline sounded great but as we know TEPCO and the government lack being honest and truthful. Sadly, I expect the money won't be spent on real solutions. It's time to allow ALL countries (willing to help) assist with the many complicated challenges! If Abe truly wants to fix this disaster, he will get international help from everywhere!Hmmmmm..  2 days ago they were saying that disaster mght strijke in the next 2 or 3 weeks unless urgent action was taken.  Now they are saying that leakage already substantial?I have hung in for a long time, but it's time to leave Japan.  I love Japan, but It's just not safe for the family long term IMO.Stabilizing the Fukushima plant is our challenge,for the day"" Abe said at a meeting of the governments disaster task force."" in particular, the contaminated water is an urgent issue which has generated a great deal of public attention today There, finished it for ya Abe.“swift and steady measures”Ah, so in 10 years they'll start to do something? Maybe form a panel to think about a discussion on it? It has only taken 2.5 years and literally daily admittances by TEPCO for the past two weeks for Abe, who has pledged to get rid of nuclear weapons while exporting Japanese nuclear technology, to ""think about it"". His measure after he pledged to solve the problem? give it to someone else, of course. Here's what needs to be done for anything to be actually done: 1) declare any and all exports from Japan to be potentially contaminated and require strict radiation level checks. 2) Stop calling the incident ""the worst thing since Chernobyl"" and start admitting it's just worse. 3) Tell TEPCO they are going to have to pay for it, not the taxpayers while TEPCO tries to get back in the black. 4) Put all TEPCO heads, now and since before the disaster, in jail. 5) Do something. Instead of saying you're going to be decisive about thinking about it.smithinjapan, Great.5) Do something.This is about the only real thing in your proposal to deal with the accident. You are qualified to a TEPCO board member or an METI official.CH3CHO: ""This is about the only real thing in your proposal to deal with the accident""Nope, just the only one to a person who is not an apologist. Weren't you defending TEPCO on the leaks just a few hours ago? ""You are qualified to a TEPCO board member or an METI official.""Be careful! That might actually make them reliable. Then you would just blame foreigners. So what's your solution, bud?They should have contracted with the French to fix this mess a long time ago. Tepco and Japan's ""nuclear village"" are well out of their depth. But hey, national pride comes first.Wow believing the stories of ""A Japanese government official.""This is not good. 300 tons of toxic water leaking into the sea from Fukushima? And we are supposed to support the Fukushima folk by buying up their fish?? Their agricultural products etc..?? Anybody know if this toxic radiation waste can be tracked?? If the UN, USA etc...is tracking this mess?? How far from Fukushima is this mess going?? Just a couple of questions I would like to have answered. As for those who want to escape from Japan, can we blame them??Finally!! Yes finally we know that is how much toxic waste is the dumped into the ocean daily  basis. However, I have to say that this is unacceptable and it needs to be fixed now!!!!JeffLeeAug. 07, 2013 - 07:16PM JST They should have contracted with the French to fix this mess a long time ago. I think TEPCO did more than 2 years ago. http://www.areva.com/EN/news-8834/special-japan-eight-experts-joined-the-team-already-in-place-in-tokyo.htmlBut hey, national pride comes first.Is this myth still alive in English speaking community?Other than admitting it, and METI already getting their snouts into the yen trough, what are the government really going to do about it? They have no pollution experts, unless you include polluters such as Sumitomo (remember Universal Studio Osaka) and Chissho Metal (Minamata), and most of their expertise is in cover-up and denial until plaintiffs die off. Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi are only expert at building nuclear power plants, not decommissioning them, and in a recent case of pollution in the river at near OkuTama, they could not even identify the source of the pollution.Even overseas experts have no experience in a managing 3 broken reactors where they have no idea where the melted fuel assemblies are, and re-routing entire groundwater flows. The best chances are with the likes of the US Army Corps of Engineers, responsible for waterways in the USA, and some cleanups of places like Hanford and Savannah, sites of the US nuclear programmes; the Pan-American Centre for Sanitary Engineering and Environmental Services, and some of the mining support companies in West Virginia, who are used to dealing with pollution  from mines. They use grout curtains, soil/ cement-slurry walls and other techniques to create impermeable barriers.If it carries on like this, and the leaking radioactive water starts circulating in the Pacific, they'll certainly want to get involved.Even overseas experts have no experience in a managing 3 broken reactors where they have no idea where the melted fuel assemblies are, and re-routing entire groundwater flows.Finally someone told it, and this is why nuclear power shouldn't be used. We haven't developed the proper technology  to deal with nuclear disaster yet.The best chances are with the likes of the US Army Corps of Engineers, responsible for waterways in the USA, and some cleanups of places like Hanford and Savannah, sites of the US nuclear programmesI read that the situation at Hanford Site isn't good at all.
http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/21/us/washington-hanford-leakThe ministry official also said the government plans to reduce the leakage amount to 60 tons per day by as early as December.Oh fantastic news we can all relax now , by december there will only be 60 tons per day leaching into the food chain, what a relief    N O T .Bring in international help as much as is needed, swallow your pride as, your pride is now beyond saving anyway (the world is disgusted with tthe way japan has handled this) , get help, be humble and get this mess fixed for crying out loud, govt thinks throwing more money at tepco will fix the problem.CH3CHO: ""Is this myth still alive in English speaking community?""Still fact, actually. In your language it may still be a myth, though -- solving the problem sure seems to be a myth here. But hey... let's let tomorrow's headlines on the most recent admissions prove that.(the world is disgusted with tthe way japan has handled this) News about Fukushima are almost absent on the major international press, and this because wordlwide nuclear village is handling their own nuclear waste and plants in a mediocre way, so they prefer silence.wanderlustAug. 07, 2013 - 08:18PM JST Other than admitting it, and METI already getting their snouts into the yen trough, what are the government really going to do about it? If you can read Japanese, this is their plan.
http://www.tepco.co.jp/nu/fukushima-np/roadmap/images/t130627_11-j.pdfLook at the photo on page 36. TEPCO is going to freeze the soil along the blue line and place water proof steel plates along the red line up to the depth of very low hydraulic conductivity bedrock to contain the water.Until some people will think that the way Fukushima disaster is handled  is related to Japanese culture rather than at the nuclear village in general, we could never have a nuclear free world. It's a big conceptual mistake.Abe makes the same political speech as if he is getting tough. ""Swift and steady measures"", this is just a bunch of words to calm the fact that it  ""has generated a great deal of public attention.” Calm the people and do nothing.
They need to close the plant and encase the whole thing in cement. This disaster will contaminate the entire world. Rev. 8:8    The second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood,9and a third of the creatures which were in the sea and had life, died; Japan needs to stop hiding their mess. Soon the only food you will be able to safely eat will be imported. I really do not care if people like the truth.Gov't says Fukushima plant leaking 300 tons of toxic water into sea dailySurprise that no global authority has sued  Japan for polluting the world and poisoning the global commons such as the sea and its beautiful biota and ecosystem? Such japan-style culture of lack of accountability is reason why Abe has the guts to globe-trot, peddling Japanese nuclear technology, even at its lowest popularity....They need to close the plant and encase the whole thing in cement. I guess they can't do it. Also, it's not like Chernobyl site is really safe now. The last winter the roof collapsed at the nuclear power plant under the weight of snow.http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/chernobyl-radiation-unaffected-roof-collapse-article-1.1263037Good grief...in most parts of the world if there is a major disaster, the government steps in to assist instead of playing the blame game.Fix the problem first, then looks for the incompetent bufffoons who caused the problem and take corrective action so it does not happen again.Abe can call for ""swift and steady measures"" all he wants until the cows come home but its futile. Whatever arises from their actions will be too little too late.  In part this slow government response regarding the groundwater three weeks from a disaster will be thanks to the japanese public who have swept the disaster under the rug without taking proactive steps and raising their voice against the government to spur action.  It's extremely frustrating because this is no longer Japan's problem but the entire globes.@CH3CHOEight members? LOL. No, I mean contracted to supervise and manage the cleanup project overall. Meanwhile, keep Tepco and its sub-sub contracted low-skilled temporary workers (paid 10,000 yen a day with no benefits) a safe distance away while the pros do the job.I spoke to over a dozen of my Japanese students about this today. They ranged in age from early 20's to late 60's and nor one of them had any comment at all! The only thing they did was to shrug they shoulders and avoid the topic. Is this the mindset of the Japanese? They are more concerned about who will be voted the next leader of AKB than they are about TEPCO poisoning the whole east coast and their government, which they voted for, abusing all the power they were given. I, on the other hand, am gonna do everything I can to make people see how stupid they are being and to get my kids off my ex-wife and get them of this poisoned island asylum!  Minamata was exactly the same situation and it took nearly ten years before the few people effected by to stand up and get some action, which is still being procrastinated over some 40 odd years later. If the contaminated water is leaking into the sea at such a huge rate it is also leaking into the aquifer and ultimately into the drinking water. The same stuff you shower in! I read a report a few months (not on JT) that the ground under dai-ichi had actually cracked and the radioactive water was running into the underground water table. Enough is enough! For 2.5 years we have had these TEPCO wankers lying to us and the go tenement ignoring the pathetic BS that is going on up there and then stating that it is all under control. It is all BS! 300 tons of water every day is not a drop in the ocean. It is a major contamination!They should have contracted with the French to fix this mess a long time ago. Tepco and Japan's ""nuclear village"" are well out of their depth. But hey, national pride comes first.I rather believe TEPCO does not want to open and expose themselves, they lied so much all over the course of the action, they are lying on everything and that does also include overcharging cleaning cost. If they do request help from abroad they will have to first answer questions and they do not want it, plus they do not want to loose the control on the ""cost"". Staying between Japanese corp, used to price fixing and how to share public fund is what they are doing.an estimated 300 tons of contaminated water is leaking into the ocean per day300 tons per day is hardly a ""leak"", more like a deluge.I have hung in for a long time, but it's time to leave Japan. I love Japan, but It's just not safe for the family long term IMO.Is your spouse Japanese? If so, good luck with that!...the highly radioactive water seeping into the ocean from the Fukushima plant was creating an ""emergency""......which is expected to take more than 40 years and cost $11 billion.Any highly radioactive substance takes 10,000 years to fully decay.Disillusioned: ""Is this the mindset of the Japanese?""Yes, you J-basher! Now go out there and try to help and see the response you get! (aside: praise them first for... well... Watanabe Ken or something).TEPCO needs English lessons. ""Seeping"" and ""Leaking"" does not equal 300 Tons of water every day into the ocean. I rest my case.We used to say ""We Japanese live in harmony with nature"". No more. Now we must say ""We Japanese poison nature, and our own children, with lies and stupid old greedy men.""300 tons is not leak. It is tsunami every day.Hi Boardies.
Q plz.
What is the equilivant of  300 tons of water?
How many Olympic swimming pools?
Thx.That is very good day for TEPCO hip hip hurra..., they just secured a hell of cash from public fund for a very long time, bonuses for executives can flow at will !  As for us, minimum of 40 years of just ""must pay"", ""must get contaminated"" and ""must shut-up"".I would go so far as to say that tepco management are as criminally negligent as the wall street suits that caused the GFC.
And like them,no-one from tepco has been deemed responsible.Pathetic and inept governing by all parties.Bring in international help as much as is needed, swallow your pride as, your pride is now beyond saving anyway (the world is disgusted with tthe way japan has handled this)
The truth is, 'the world' doesn't have a Scooby because it isn't being reported...anywhere! Nobody knows. When I get talking to people and I get asked why I left Japan and cite the nuclear problem as one of the reasons (it wasn't the main reason but it was certainly a contributing factor) I just get reactions of incredulity. I'd say the international community is going out of its way to avoid reporting anything about it. It gets a mention on the BBC every March and then it's just about the anniversary of the disasters - nothing more.My wife is Japanese and my kids are Japanese, they were born here in Tokyo and they are both more willing than I am to escape from Japan! As long as my home is still standing, and that mess up in Fukushima does not explode and send that radiation crap down here to Tokyo, I will not think too much about escaping from Japan. But I am sure many others do not think like me and they have already left Japan or are getting ready to escape ASAP!While we huff and puff I can't really expect much to change with the current lot of TEPCO executives, government officials and politicians. The man in the street needs to get up and do something but given the apathy of the average Japanese can't expect much. Pathetic reactions to disasters are a part of life here. Look at Kobe. The reaction was a joke just as this one is too. What and when will the next big disaster be and how many people will die because of incompetance, corruption and arrogance. I envy you, Elbuda Mexicano, in having a family which can see things for how they really are.JeffLeeAug. 07, 2013 - 09:41PM JST @CH3CHO

Don't  eat sea food!Contaminated seas and seafood, innocent victims, lost livelihoods, cozy ties between government and major corporation, cover-ups, lies, denials and evasions, scores of deaths and court battles that take decades to resolve: look no further than the sad story of Minamata disease.  I almost believe that this particular case has emboldened the government, and Tepco, into assuming that they can get away with anything if they keep lying about it for long enough.  And sadly, knowing the Japanese people as I do, I think they may be right.What METI disclosed today says that natural underground water runs beneath the nuclear power plant site with an estimated amount of 1000 tons per day. Of that amount, 400 tons per day contacts highly contaminated water that contains melted down nuclear fuel. But the water is captured and stored in tanks. 600 tons per day runs unnoticed beneath the site. But since the site is contaminated, the water may be contaminated. Quite frankly, I do not know if I should believe that account or not. No one knows if the estimate of 1000 tons a day is correct. No one knows where the unknown underground water runs and if it contacts radioactive material. Cesium is known stay on the surface of soil. It could be just a story to get budget, but can be real.""Solving the problem is our challenge""Wow, sounds really urgent... sigh300 tons a day probably isn't a lot compared to the whole pacific ocean but as that material is concentrated moving up the food chain it could become a problem.  I wonder what the measurements are further up the coast.Months ago I said we were all just frogs being boiled slowly with the way the government was doling out information in bits and bobs.  They'd give us some bad news, deny anything worse and then once we got comfortable with that initial bad news, they'd give us more and repeat the cycle.  Nothing has changed.  If they're admitting this now I can only imagine how much worse it really is.Nipporinoel - 300t is about 1/8 of an olympic pool.@ChibaChick.

  The religious scholar has issued a ruling forbidding the building
  of snowmen, and snow animals for being anti-Islamic.

  Deferring to other Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued the
  action is considered sinful under Sunni Islam for creating an

  Another social media user argued the snow was there ""for
  fleeting days, maybe even hours,"" and blamed the scholar for
  stealing all the joy and fun it brings.

  The storm swept across the Middle East last week, hitting a
  number of countries where snow is rarely seen even in winter.
  While a state of emergency has been declared in some regions,
  including Gaza and the West Bank, people in parts of Saudi Arabia
  have been enjoying the rare occurrence in its usually

          / CBS/AP
        A second worker at the Texas hospital where a Liberian man died of Ebola has tested positive for the disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said early Wednesday morning. The agency said the positive result was returned from a preliminary test, and that ""confirmation testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's laboratory is being done.""The worker was in isolation at a Dallas hospital within 90 minutes of her finding she had an elevated temperature, officials said. They also said she lives alone with no pets.After revealing her diagnosis, the CDC also announced the health care worker had taken a flight from Cleveland to Dallas the day before presenting symptoms. Officials are trying to track down all 132 passengers aboard.In response to the latest Ebola case, the White House announced Tuesday that Obama is calling off a planned trip to New Jersey and Connecticut and instead will convene Cabinet officials coordinating the government's Ebola response.Crews were at the health care worker's apartment early Wednesday morning, located in north Dallas, reports CBS Dallas. They began decontaminating the complex's common areas and the space outside of the patient's home, as well as distributing flyers to residents. The patient's vehicle and apartment unit will be decontaminated starting early Wednesday afternoon.Flyer distributed to residents in cmplx of 2nd hlth care wrkr w/Ebola. @dallaspiosana @DallasFireRes_q #DallasEbola pic.twitter.com/dC1RY6MoLE@DallasFireRes_q Haz-Mat taping off door. pic.twitter.com/1uJQCzV9SgDallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said at a news conference Wednesday that the health care provider at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital had been monitoring herself for symptoms of Ebola. The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed in a separate statement that the health worker did provide care to Thomas Eric Duncan, whom officials refer to as ""the index patient"" and is the Liberian national who died at Presbyterian on Oct. 8. Duncan was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on U.S. soil, although he is believed to have contracted the disease while still in Liberia.It was not immediately clear what contact the new case had with Duncan.Officials have said they also don't know how the first health worker, a nurse, became infected. But the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said ""an additional health care worker testing positive for Ebola is a serious concern.""	""What happened there (in Dallas), regardless of the reason, is not acceptable. It shouldn't have happened,"" Anthony Fauci, director of the Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of NIH, said on MSNBC Wednesday.The state health agency said the new patient had been interviewed, ""to quickly identify any contacts or potential exposures, and those people will be monitored. The type of monitoring depends on the nature of their interactions and the potential they were exposed to the virus.""""We want to remind Dallas County residents not to panic and overreact,"" said county health director Zach Thompson. ""We just want Dallas County residents to stay calm.""Nurse Nina Pham, the first person to contract Ebola on U.S. soil, also got the disease while caring for Duncan. She repeatedly visited his room from  the day he was admitted to the intensive care unit until the day before  he died, medical records show. Pham and other health  care workers wore protective gear, including gowns, gloves, masks and  face shields -- and sometimes full-body suits -- when caring for Duncan, but confirmation of the new case came a day after a national nurses union decried an absence of protocols at the Texas hospital.When Pham's mother learned she was caring for Duncan, she tried to reassure her that she would be safe.	Pham told her: ""Mom, no. Don't worry about me,"" family friend Christina Tran told The Associated Press.	Duncan's medical records make numerous mentions of protective gear worn by hospital staff, and Pham herself notes wearing the gear in visits to Duncan's room. But there is no indication in the records of her first encounter with Duncan, on Sept. 29, that Pham donned any protective gear.Leaders of the National Nurses Union  read a statement Tuesday which they said represented concerns from a  number of nurses that work at Texas Health Presbyterian in Dallas. The  union officials declined to identify the Dallas nurses or say how many  were participating in the statement.But they were vociferous in  citing a lack of protocols on the day Duncan was  admitted with extreme symptoms of Ebola.Among the flaws cited by the group included: ""Were protocols breached?"" said union spokeswoman Rose Ann DeMoro, ""There were no protocols.""""These  nurses are not well protected. They're not prepared to handle Ebola or  any other pandemic,"" said DeMoro. ""We are deeply alarmed.""DeMoro  said the nurses who had come forward were afraid to reveal their  identities ""because of a culture of threat in the hospitals.""Tuesday night, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital issued a statement in response to the nurses' charges, saying, ""patient  and employee safety is our greatest priority and we take compliance  very seriously.""The hospital insisted that ""numerous measures"" were in place ""to provide a safe  working environment, including mandatory annual training and a 24-7  hotline and other mechanisms that allow for anonymous reporting.""  But also on Tuesday, the nation's top  disease-fighting agency acknowledged that federal health experts  failed to do all they should have done to prevent Ebola from spreading in Dallas when and after Duncan was admitted.CDC Director Tom Frieden outlined a series of steps designed to  stop the spread of the disease in the U.S., including increased training  for health care workers and changes at Texas Health Presbyterian to minimize the risk of more infections. He also said the CDC was forming rapid response teams to intervene wherever an Ebola diagnosis presents itself in the U.S. ""within hours.""A total of 76 people at the hospital  might have had exposure to Duncan, and all of them were  being monitored for fever and other symptoms daily, Frieden said. It wasn't immediately confirmed that the new case was one of the 76 people being monitored.Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell told ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday there haven't been any alterations of the virus that would raise concern about protocols.With 30 years of treatment and containment ofthe Ebola virus behind them, Burwell said they knew to implement additional oversight to ensure those protocols were implemented this time. ""There will be 24/7 site managers who will oversee the taking on and taking off of equipment, as well as the fact that we've added additional CDC staff on site,"" she said on ""CBS This Morning.""Another possibility for spreading the disease was the ""the interventions that were done to try desperately to keep the index patient alive, (including) dialysis and intubation. These are two procedures which can result in the spread of infectious material,"" CDC head Frieden said.Starting Sunday, the CDC began re-evaluating the protocols for using protective gear and limiting the number of Ebola patients a facility can treat, reports CBS News correspondent Vicente Arenas.

He added investigators ""will leave no stone unturned"".While the cause of the crash has not been determined, US Vice President Joe Biden cautiously suggested the crash was ""not an accident"" and that the jet had ""apparently blown out of the sky"", while a US official said that, while its origin was unclear, a surface-to-air missile was probably responsible.""I say 'apparently' because we don't actually have all the details. I want to be sure of what I say. Apparently, shot down. Shot down, not an accident. Blown out of the sky,"" he said.It should have arrived in Malaysia at 6:10am local time, but did not enter Russian airspace when it was expected to, a Russian aviation source told Reuters.The Eurocontrol organsiation, which co-ordinates European air traffic control, closed air routes in eastern Ukraine on Thursday evening.The incident came one day after US President Barack Obama levied broad economic sanctions on Russia as punishment for its threatening behaviour towards Ukraine.Amid tensions in the region, Russian President Vladmir Putin blamed Ukraine for the crash, the Kremlin said in a statement early on Friday.Putin opened a meeting with his economic advisers by calling for a moment of silence over the crash, but added: ""This tragedy would not have happened if there were peace on this land, if the military actions had not been renewed in southeast Ukraine. And, certainly, the state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy.""Russian-backed Ukrainian rebels and the Ukraine government have accused each other of carrying out the ground-to-air strike, with both issuing firm denials of any involvement in the disaster.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko responding by calling the crash a ""terrorist"" attack which posed a challenge to the whole world, his website said.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesEPAEPAReutersEPAAFPAFPAFP/GettyAFP/GettyAFPEPAGetty Images Getty Images REXAPGetty ImagesReutersReutersAPReutersAPReutersReutersAP/Andrei KashtanovReutersReutersEPAAFP/Getty ImagesReutersEPAAP""Today's tragedy showed again that terrorism is not localised, but a world problem. And the external aggression against Ukraine is not just our problem, but a threat to European and global security,"" he said.Shortly after the crash, rebel leader Alexander Borodai told the RIA-Novosti agency that discussions were under way with Ukrainian authorities on calling a three-day cease fire for humanitarian reasons.He added that international organisations would be allowed into the region.Prior to the suggestion of a truce, the Poroshenko rejected claims by Ukraine rebels that Kiev was responsible and said his country's armed forces did not shoot at any airborne targets.“We do not exclude that this plane was shot down, and we stress that the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not take action against any airborne targets,” he said.“We are sure that those who are guilty in this tragedy will be held responsible,"" he added.An official statement from the Ukraine government blamed Russian air defence systems it claimed are protecting ""terrorists"" in the area.It said: ""A large passenger aircraft Boeing 777, performing a flight between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, was shot down in the eastern part of Ukraine. According to the General Staff of Ukrainian Armed Forces, the plane was shot down by the Russian Buk missile system as the liner was flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters.""Ukraine has no long-range air defence missile systems in this area.""The plane was shot down, because the Russian air defence systems was affording protection to Russian mercenaries and terrorists in this area.""Ukraine will present the evidence of Russian military involvement into the Boeing crash.""The leader of the terrorists Igor Girkin (Strelkov) immediately commented on the catastrophe, believing that it was the Ukrainian jet that crashed: 'In Torez An-26 was shot down, its crashes are lying somewhere near the coal mine “Progress”. We have warned everyone: do not fly in our skies,'"" the statement read. Anton Gerashenko, an aide to the Ukrainian Interior Minister, wrote on his Facebook page that the Boeing airliner, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was at an altitude of 33,000ft when it was hit by a missile fired from a Buk launcher and crashed near the city of Donetsk - a stronghold of pro-Russian rebels.But Russia’s military said that none of its military planes had been flying close to the Russia-Ukraine border on Thursday, RIA Novosti reported citing a military official.Earlier, Aleksandr Boroday, Prime Minister of the recently established Donetsk People's Republic, denied the jet had been shot down by the rebels and called the incident a “provocation by the Ukrainian military”.“We confirm that the plane crashed not far from Donetsk,” Boroday said. “Representatives of Donetsk People's Republic have headed to the scene.”“Self-defence forces have no air-defence, which could target transport aircraft at that height,” he told Interfax.In separate reports by Interfax, an unidentified pro-Russian separatists said they had found the jet's black box flight recorder.The Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has ordered an investigation into what he has called an ""airplane catastrophe"", his spokeswoman Olga Lappo said on Thursday.Elsewhere, world leaders issued statements expressing their shock, and calling for potential culprits to be brought to justice.President Obama called the crash a ""terrible tragedy"", and said his government's priority was to determine whether any Americans were killed.During a pre-planned phone conversation, Obama and Putin discussed the crash, the White House and Kremlin both confirmed.Meanwhile, US senator John McCain warned that there will be “hell to pay” if the Russia military or Ukrainian separatists are deemed to have had any involvement in the 'incident'.“If the Malaysian plane was shot down, this is obviously a game changer and has horrific consequences,"" he warned.“It has the earmarks of a tragic mistake made by someone who had the capability to just shoot down an aircraft, and we know at least from the last couple of weeks that that could be Russian or separatist Russian capability.”""But if it is the result of either separatist or Russian actions mistakenly believing this was a Ukrainian war plane, I think there’s going to be hell to pay and there should be,"" he said in an interview on MSNBC, citing previous reports of separatists shooting down Ukrainian fighter planes.His comments followed a tweet by the Malaysian Prime Minister, following his later statement, in which he said he was ""shocked"" by reports of a plane crash, and that an investigation was being launched into the incident immediately.This video posted online purported to show the aftermath of the crashAs pictures emerged showing loved ones of those on board the flight gathering at both Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Sepang, and Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands Prime Minister Marke Rutte also said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the crash, NL Times reported.""I am deeply shocked by the tragic news about the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur via Ukrainian territory,” he said.“Very much is still unclear about the facts, the circumstances and the passengers.”Late on Thursday, newly appointed Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called for an UN-led international investigation to establish what caused the flight to crash, with a meeting of the Government's emergency committee - Cobra - expected to meet on Friday.""I'm deeply shocked by this appalling incident and I send my heartfelt condolences to all those who may have lost family and friends. We're determined to get to the bottom of understanding what has happened here,"" he said.Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a statement that if the plane crash was deliberate, it constituted an ""unspeakable crime"" for which the perpetrators must be swiftly brought to justice.""It is a very, very sad time, made worse by reports that it might be a crime rather than an accident,"" Abbott said.Shortly after the crash, Malaysia Airlines posted a tweet on its official account confirming it had ""lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam"".""The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace. More details to follow.""It said early on Friday that all of its European flights will take routes avoiding Ukraine.Virgin Airlines, Lufthansa and British Airways have confirmed that they are diverting most of their flights away from Ukrainian airspace.A spokesman from BA said: “The safety and security of our customers is always our top priority. Our flights are not using Ukrainian airspace, with the exception of our once a day service between Heathrow and Kiev.""Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesReutersReutersEPAWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

191,"Ottawa shooting: A day of chaos leaves soldier, gunman dead","Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in an evening address that Canada would not be intimidated by Wednesday's ""brutal and violent attack"" in Ottawa, in which an armed attacker shot and fatally wounded a Canadian Forces member at the National War Memorial before being shot dead in Parliament's Centre Block.The slain soldier is Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist from Hamilton.Moments after Cirillo was shot at his post by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, MPs and other witnesses reported 30 to 50 shots fired inside the main Parliament building.It was confirmed later that the gunman was shot dead inside the building, felled by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms and RCMP, according to MPs' accounts.CBC News has confirmed the dead shooting suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982. CBC News has learned that Zehaf-Bibeau has a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges. Court documents from that time show that he lived at an address in Montreal.He also has a criminal record in B.C., where he was convicted in 2012 of uttering threats and served one day in jail.In his brief address, Harper offered condolences for Cirillo's family, and for the family of Patrice Vincent, another soldier who was killed in an attack earlier this week.""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil,"" he said.""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered their own statements, condemning the attacks and pledging support for the government.Harper, who was on Parliament Hill at the time of the shooting and was safely whisked away, met with members of his cabinet before making his address. He then met with the Conservative caucus, who had been in lockdown on the Hill until after 8 p.m. ET.Harper's spokesman Carl Vallée said on Twitter that Harper also spoke briefly to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon. Harper also spoke with Mulcair and Trudeau, the Prime Minister's Office said.Hundreds of people, including children at a daycare, waited hours to be evacuated from Parliament Hill as the area remained under lockdown. Late Wednesday OC Transpo buses began taking people away from the Hill as the lockdown eased.In an afternoon news conference, police would not say whether they still suspect another shooter is involved, saying only ""there is no one in custody at this time.""""This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,"" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the national division.Michaud also suggested that police had no forewarning of the attack, saying ""it caught us by surprise."" He added that it's too soon to say whether the dead gunman was already known to security officials.Michaud added that police have maintained a ""medium"" level of security of Parliament for the past number of years, and that had not changed in recent days.Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau asked witnesses to the incidents to come forward.Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed four people were taken to hospital: the soldier who died, and three who were released after treatment for minor injuries. One of those injured was a parliamentary security guard shot in the foot, according to CBC's Judy Trinh.Despite earlier reports of shots fired near the Rideau Centre shopping mall east of Parliament Hill, police later said ""no incident occurred near the Rideau Centre.""Alain Merisier, who works at the cafeteria in one of the Parliament Buildings, told CBC News that he saw a man in a car at the Centre Block with a long gun.CBC video and cellphone video shot by a Globe and Mail reporter showed a chaotic scene in the elegant hallway leading from the front doors of Parliament's Centre Block to the Library of Parliament during the attack.A sustained volley of shots was fired. Startled security personnel and political staff scrambled to take cover in the limestone alcoves as bullets flew.In the minutes after the shooting, MPs and parliamentary staff began tweeting and telling reporters that it was Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers who shot the gunman. The tweets included:Earlier, police sealed off the area around the National War Memorial while the injured soldier was given emergency medical aid. ""We were waiting there for a city tour and suddenly I heard four shots,"" said Jan Lugtenborg, a tourist visiting downtown Ottawa from Holland.""Suddenly I saw a small guy with long black hair … with a long rifle, and he ran away after the shots, across streets in the direction of Parliament Hill,"" he said.Raivo Nommick, another bystander, said ""all of a sudden, I just heard a shot, turned around and there was a guy with a rifle .... and just pow pow.""Then I saw one of the other Armed Forces guys just running. He barrelled over, just ran right over. The other guy just dropped. I looked back and just dived underneath and immediately called 911.""Scott Walsh, who was working on Parliament Hill, said he saw a man running with a double-barrelled shotgun, wearing a scarf and blue jeans.Walsh said the man hopped over the stone fence that surrounds Parliament Hill, forcing someone out of their car at gunpoint. He then drove to the front doors of Parliament and fired at least two shots, Walsh said.New Democrat MP Hélène Laverdière said she heard 20 to 30 shots inside Parliament, and hit the floor. She and fellow MPs Charlie Angus and Rosane Doré Lefebvre were later led out of the Centre Block to safety.MP Doré Lefebvre worried about getting her daughter from the daycare facility on Parliament Hill. Children from the daycare were not released until about 8 p.m.On mobile? Follow our live blog hereTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about.Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature.

The move would entitle Las Vegas to a professional sports franchise in one of the four major sports league's for the first time in the city's history. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has previously voiced disapproval of such a move out of concern over the city's potentially damaging connection to the sports betting industry.  MORE: Which arenas would house the teams? | Team's name and rosterOn Wednesday morning, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly publicly denied that anything was imminent in Las Vegas.Seattle has been at the center of expansion rumors for more than a year and Quebec City has a new arena that is slated to open in 2015.

The DeAndre Joshua Murder ","DeAndre Joshua, 20, was murdered on the same night of the Saint Louis Grand Jury announcement. DeAndre was shot in the head, and then a flammable liquid poured on him and set afire inside his vehicle.DeAndre Joshua also fits the social profile of several eye-witnesses who gave the police/FBI statements and testified before the Grand Jury in the Mike Brown shooting case.  If that were the only coincidence it might be easy to dismiss.  Alas, it’s not. Out of an abundance of caution for other witnesses we are avoiding outlining the most direct connections. As you are aware DeAndre  was an employed black male, with no history of drug use or illicit behavior.  In the Canfield Community marijuana is not considered illicit, nor does weed really qualify as drug use – it’s as common as tobacco.  DeAndre was also a friend of Dorian Johnson who is currently under protection.Obviously his friend, Dorian Johnson is very alarmed, understandably so. On the  night before the Grand Jury announcement, there were considerable nerves amid a select group in the Ferguson community.As the attention of a nation turned to the grand jury decision, and also to the demands of the Justice for Mike Brown coalition, Dorian Johnson was potentially going to be the recipient of a tremendous amount of angst.  Several people were looking for DeAndre and Dorian.Dorian was in hiding – DeAndre was vulnerable.
Another witness who falls into this almost identical profile is Witness #35, who has been identified under the name “Viron”.  However, even the FBI agents who interviewed Viron are unsure of his actual identity.
Witness #35 presented himself for FBI interview with an “uncle”, and a female attorney.  When it came to identify himself, well, the ambiguity is almost unbelievable were it not documented by the federal authorities.  (See Page #32)
Witness #35 would not give his real name, nor his social security number, nor his address or contact information, and would only sign his statement with an alias.
In hindsight, and against the backdrop of the death of DeAndre Joshua, the reluctance of Witness #35 might lead a researcher to understand a prescient fear was not unfounded.
However, social media is identifying a profile that fits a connection to Dorian as described in the affidavit, Viron becomes Devorion Livingston.   Devorion is a friend to both eye-witness and robbery cohort Dorian Johnson, along with the murdered DeAndre Joshua.
Given the relationships, the connections, and the documented associations, Devorion fits the profile of Witness #35 who gave the painful to read testimony to the FBI where they were consistently reminding him, and warning him, about the risks of lying about the events.   Witness #35 read his testimony here.

Devorion Livingston is also pictured below with Dorian Johnson last year at Canfield apartment complex.  Note the vehicle in the background:DeAndre Joshua murder […]  Authorities say a pile of broken glass and blood lay beside the white Pontiac Grand Prix Joshua was found inside. (link)
Yes, that’s a White Grand Prix behind Dorian Johnson (purple shirt) and Devorian Livingston.
Both Dorian Johnson and Devorion Livingston found out about DeAndre’s brutal murder at approximately the same time.
Dorian Johnson, who is in protective custody, was understandably freaking out.

Below you can see how Devorion Livingston payed homage to his now murdered friend the day he found out.

Apparently the three Canfield friends, Devorion, Dorian and DeAndre, knew each other for quite some time.
However, prior to the grand jury announcement Devorion Livingston and his pregnant wife (?) got the heck outta dodge Ferguson.   (click to enlarge and read the FB narrative)

Obviously DeAndre Joshua didn’t leave Ferguson – he was murdered last Monday in Canfield Greens Apartment complex, mere yards away from where Mike Brown was shot.
So the ultimate question becomes is this just mere coincidence?  Dorian, Devorian and DeAndre being close friends.  Dorian in hiding, Devorian having left town, and DeAndre now murdered.   A person would have to be exceptionally obtuse not to see the connections.
But if it’s not a coincidence, then why?
Street Justice Rules – Witness #14 gives a chilling account of what would happen to these kids if they told the wrong story – and what were the risks.
Initially Witness #14 talked to State investigators – however, in his August 12th statement he mentioned the false story surrounding the “hands up – don’t shoot” narrative;  and the  pressure from the community to tell lies in support of the construct (read here).
That initial statement prompted the FBI to come and visit Witness #14 specifically to talk about that aspect of his statement.
Within the FBI interview  -a day before he was scheduled to appear before the grand jury- Witness #14 tells the FBI not only about the “hand’s up” story being totally made up by the community, but also that Mike Brown’s step-dad, Louis Head, was the enforcer to insure compliance (read here).
Apparently Louis Head was the threat to make sure that all of the witnesses in/around Canfield Greens Apartment complex said the right things, the “hands up – don’t shoot” things.Louis Head was also the person who gained notoriety by climbing upon a vehicle and shouting “Burn This Bitch Down” the night DeAndre was murdered……. The night DeAndre Joshua was indeed “burned down” while seated in his Grand Prix.Witness #14 was scheduled to testify on September 25th at 10:30am.  He never showed up.
Perhaps these are all coincidences.  Perhaps.
However, perhaps Louis Head, and those of like-minded association, also hold the greatest motive for anger toward Dorian Johnson, and as a consequence toward anyone who was unsuccessful at getting Justice for Mike Brown.
Several of the eye-witnesses, who gave honest testimony to the Grand Jury, were, according to their own statements, warned immediately after the shooting to keep their mouths shut. All of the eye-witnesses were African American. If you read the reports the sense of fear about speaking the truth is overwhelming. Many, if not all, of the witness statements outlined in police reports, FBI reports, and later in Grand Jury testimony -who testified to the factual events as outlined by officer Wilson, and whose testimony fit the physical and forensic evidence- were threatened by the local Canfield Greens community.Was the murder of DeAndre Joshua an outcome of  a broken street code?  His family thinks so:(Via Daily Mail) A man has died during the Ferguson riots just yards from where Michael Brown was shot dead. Residents on Canfield Drive said that DeAndre Joshua, 20, was shot whilst in his car though police at the scene refused to confirm any details.DeAndre’s grandmother Renita Towns said that ‘somebody killed him’ during the carnage.She said that he graduated Beaumont High School and that he was working in Wal-Mart.Family member Brian Joshua, 45, added: ‘He was a good kid, he’s gone to high school, he’s got a job, he’s not into drugs or any of that stuff.‘I only saw him yesterday morning. He was a smart guy, he spoke cleanly, he was positive’.Police took away DeAndre’s white Pontiac Grand Prix and interviewed witnesses around 11am.  A woman in her 20s broke down in tears and said: ‘I knew him, he was my twin’.

233,"78 Arrested Overnight, Most From Missouri, Arrest Records Show","SectionsTVFeaturedMore from NBC Follow NBC News Jail records obtained by NBC News show that at least 78 people were arrested overnight at the protests in Ferguson, Missouri — more than double the total reported by authorities — and that the overwhelming majority of them were from Missouri.Of the 78, all but three were arrested for refusing to disperse, the records show. Two people, both from the St. Louis area, were arrested for unlawful use of a weapon, and a man from Rockton, Illinois, was arrested for interfering with an officer.Authorities had reported early that 31 people were arrested overnight. Authorities early Tuesday blamed people from out of town for some criminal activity.The records reflect people who were booked into the St. Louis County jail. It is possible, but not clear, that others were booked at other jails.The records show that 18 people from outside Missouri were arrested Monday night and early Tuesday. They came came from as far away as Brooklyn, Washington, D.C., and San Diego.Police said that they were fired on and had Molotov cocktails thrown at them overnight. Several people who were arrested and spoke to NBC News on Tuesday, however, blamed the police for overreacting to the protesters.One of the people arrested for refusing to disperse, Kyle Niere, 23, told NBC News by phone on Tuesday that he was dragged from his truck by law enforcement officers as he was trying to drive away from the protests.“They drug us all out,” said Niere, who said he lives in Ferguson and was among a group of 12 people arrested. “Face-first on the ground, stepping on the back of our heads. They’re being brutal for no reason. None of us were violent. We were just there.”Niere estimated that about 20 law enforcement officers, all from St. Louis County, descended on his truck. He said that they were protesting near the QuikTrip station, a landmark of the demonstrations, when police began firing tear gas.He said that his group walked through a residential neighborhood to get to the truck, with the intention of driving away.“They said that we just looked like the type that were going to stir up drama and go start looting,” said another person from the same group, Tina Hanna, 24, of the St. Louis suburb of Florissant. She said the arrests took place just after 2 a.m. CT.Both said that they were held overnight and released. Asked why he was protesting, Niere said: “Because I think that kid was wrongfully shot,” referring to Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who was gunned down by a Ferguson police officer Aug. 9.Even if Brown assaulted the officer, he said, “I thought that’s why cops carry mace and non-lethal weapons.”He said that the arrest of the officer, Darren Wilson, would stop the protests.“I think that would completely settle everything,” he said.Chozen Botley, 34, of the St. Louis suburb of Jennings, said that police were looking for a reason to crack down on protesters.“There is no outside instigator,” he said. “Mike Brown is in all of us. He’s with all of us. The brutality that we face as black Americans, you can face the same brutality as a white American. I just want to let the world know that all of the stuff that’s going on in Jennings, in Ferguson — there is no outsiders because we are all one.”The Highway Patrol is in charge of security in Ferguson, backed by the Missouri National Guard. Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson told MSNBC on Tuesday that he hoped the peaceful protesters would stay home after dark.“Protest during the daytime and stay home at night, and let us take those that have been out ruining our community and take them and deal with them in a way that brings calm to this community,” he said.© 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",104923,3213,25405,1513,77,1374,"0"

245,Story of the $72 million teen trader unravels,"Do Not Sell Jessica Pressler wrote the profile of Mohammed Islam, a senior at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, for a feature called ""Reasons to Love New York.""  After getting an advanced look at Pressler's piece, the New York Post put the improbable story on its Sunday front page. By Monday morning, Islam's story was one of the hottest on Facebook.  Then it fell apart. In an interview with the New York Observer published Monday night, Islam admitted that he fabricated the whole story and has never actually made a return on any investment. ""So it's total fiction?"" asked the Observer. ""Yes,"" Islam said. (updated)  Early Monday, CNBC's Josh Brown wondered if Islam was duping ""an overly eager press willing to believe.""  Pressler, who will be joining a financial investigative unit at Bloomberg News early next year, takes exception to Brown's characterization.  ""I still think the piece is skeptical enough,"" she told CNNMoney early Monday afternoon. ""The story says, 'This is a rumor and draw your own conclusions.'""  In the New York Magazine story, Pressler wrote that the amount of money is ""unbelievable,"" though she also said ""as rumors go, this one seemed legit."" Later, Pressler wrote that Islam ""confirmed his net worth is in the 'high eight figures.'""  She said Islam provided a bank statement to a New York magazine fact-checker, and that the teen does have ""an obscene amount of money in his account.""  ""I think that kid is the real deal,"" she said.  Pressler said the problem stemmed from the story's original headline: ""A Stuyvesant senior made $72 million trading stocks on his lunch break.""  Pressler said she didn't write it. ""I feel like the headline was pretty glib - I feel comfortable about what's in the actual piece.""  It has since been changed online to: ""Because a Stuyvesant Senior Made Millions Picking Stocks. His Hedge Fund Opens as Soon As He Turns 18.""  The idea that anybody, much less a teenager, could make $72 million trading was questionable.  Business Insider did its own reporting on Monday, eventually learning from an unnamed ""source familiar with the story"" that the figure was off the mark. Islam's high school Investment Club told Business Insider it performed ""due dilligence"" and discovered that ""these claims are false"" and had been hyped by ""the media in the interests of sensationalism.""  Islam then splashed cold water on the figure himself, telling CNBC on Monday that he doesn't even know who started the rumor. He also took issue with Pressler's write-up. ""The way we were portrayed is not who we are,"" CNBC quoted him as saying.  In a statement to CNBC, New York Magazine defended Pressler's reporting, noting the headline change and the fact that the ""story itself does not specify an amount.""  It isn't hard to see why the story initially got so much attention. Pressler followed Islam and a pair of his friends around as they dined on caviar and fresh-squeezed apple juice. There's a casual reference to a ""hedge-fund guy"" who wants to give the three youngsters $150 million to invest.  They spoke in reverential terms about the Koch brothers and the ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" with Islam in the role of Jordan Belfort.  But Pressler seemed perplexed by all the scrutiny.  ""Holding it to the standard of a financial publication? It's just a different thing,"" she said. ""That's not to say it isn't important if he lied.""  ""If he lied, then he lied,"" she added. ""But I just want to be clear that we didn't 100% follow this lie. That's just not what happened.""  The story, in her mind, was still worth doing.  ""The story is the reason to love New York,"" she said. ""And I came to love the fact that these kids are running around the city with these big dreams. It can only happen in New York, these kids eating caviar, talking about how they're going to be the new Koch bothers. It seems like a uniquely New York milieu.""  Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Pressler would lead an investigative unit at Bloomberg News when she joins the news service next year.

Jasmine Tridevil appeared on a local news broadcast last night, and showed off her surgical enhancement. She briefly lifted up her shirt, to which the Tampa-based reporter creepily asked her to repeat and hold up longer. Tridevil said she'd rather not, and said, ""I don't feel comfortable doing that because that's also going to be on my show."" While people have definitely been known to get outrageous surgical procedures to modify their bodies, Tridevil definitely took it to another level, and various Internet detectives are saying that this could be an elaborate bid for reality fame that is ultimately just another hoax.

272,"'Terrorist' murdered soldier 'in cold blood,' Canada's Prime Minister says","(CNN) -- First a soldier guarding a hallowed war memorial was gunned down in Canada's capital. Then shots erupted in the halls of the country's Parliament minutes later.The two shootings in Ottawa Wednesday left lawmakers barricaded inside offices and parts of the city on lockdown for hours as police searched for suspects.Ottawa Police lifted the lockdown Wednesday night and said there was no longer a danger to the public.But many questions remain about the shootings: Who was the gunman? Why did he open fire? And was he acting alone?""It appears there was just one shooter, and that shooter is dead,"" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""But it has been a traumatic experience, obviously, for not only our city but the country.""Investigators haven't provided any possible motives for the shooting. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper didn't provide details about the investigation in a televised address to the nation Wednesday night.""In the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had, but this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere in the world,"" Harper said. ""Let there be no misunderstanding: We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.""It is unclear whether additional suspects were tied to the shootings or whether additional arrests have been made. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said more information would be provided in a press conference Thursday.As authorities continued to investigate, details began to emerge about the man they suspect was behind the shooting.Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was identified by Canadian officials to their American counterparts as the suspected gunman, multiple U.S. officials told CNN.Bibeau, who was born in 1982, was a convert to Islam and had a history of drug use before he converted, two sources said.His passport had been confiscated by Canadian authorities when they learned he planned to go fight overseas, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN's Susan Candiotti. The official said it was not clear when that happened.Canadian broadcaster CBC reported that Bibeau had a record of drug arrests going back 10 years.Police now searching all rooms that weren't locked pic.twitter.com/YAVgZFau5Q'Murdered in cold blood'Cpl. Nathan Cirillo was ""murdered in cold blood"" as he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial, Harper said, expressing condolences to the slain Canadian soldier's family.The soldier appeared to have been shot in the back, said Peter Henderson, a journalist who was at the memorial at the time of the shooting. Other soldiers who were nearby doing drills at the time ran to help, he said.Three people brought to The Ottawa Hospital after the shootings have been released, hospital spokeswoman Hazel Harding told CNN. Earlier, they were described as being in stable condition.Shortly after the shooting at the memorial, a gunman entered the nearby building on Parliament Hill, officials said.""I heard rapid fire -- gunshots going very loud -- and I figure maybe 20-plus shots within 10 seconds,"" Canadian Deputy House Leader Kevin Lamoureux told CNN. He was one level below the gunshots.Gunfire first erupted in the building's foyer. Then a second round of shooting happened about a minute later in a hallway or near the entrance to the Parliament's library, Wingrove told CNN.Several officers had weapons drawn, he said, and most of the dozens of shots that he heard appeared to have been fired by officers at the gunman.When the shooting ended, a person was lying motionless on the ground near the library entrance, Wingrove said.Parliament member James Lunney tweeted: #HOC in Lockdown, lone gunman shot security guard, shot his way down Hall of Honor....we are all safe. Gunman dead! Thnk God & our scrty!""Horrific day on parliament hill. Shots fired inside centre block during our caucus meeting. I'm safe locked in a office awaiting security.In Twitter posts, several Canadian lawmakers hailed a top security official as a hero, crediting him with shooting the gunman inside Parliament.""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,"" Craig Scott, a member of Parliament, wrote.Another soldier killed MondayA U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that a connection to terrorism hasn't been ruled out.On Monday, a man who Canadian authorities said was ""radicalized"" killed a Canadian soldier with his car. The man was then shot and killed.Police: Man who ran down and killed soldier was 'radicalized'There was no immediate indication that the Monday and Wednesday incidents were related.In response to the shootings, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, has increased its alert posture, CNN has learned. That means that it has increased the number of planes on a higher alert status ready to respond if needed. NORAD and Canadian authorities are in contact, an official told CNN.A body outside ground at library of parliament pic.twitter.com/gtxWamyWmQPrime Minister secure during shootingMP Tony Clement tweeted that he heard ""at least 30 shots"" and apparently was able to take cover with colleagues. He also tweeted that Prime Minister Harper was secure.Harper was safely evacuated from the building, tweeted his press secretary, Carl Vallee.Hours after the Parliament attack, Harper spoke by phone with U.S. President Barack Obama.""Obviously, we're all shaken by it,"" Obama later told reporters, ""but we're going to do everything we can to make sure we're standing side by side with Canada during this difficult time.""Watson said that Wednesday was ""a sad and tragic day for our city and our country.""""There's no pain greater than losing a loved one -- to have it happen in such circumstances as this morning is beyond expression, and underlined by a sad anger within my heart,"" he said.Canada raised its terror threat levelThe violence at Parliament comes just days after Canada raised its terror alert Friday.The suspect in Monday's vehicle attack, Martin Rouleau Couture, reportedly converted to Islam about a year ago. Police arrested him last July and confiscated his passport, but lacked enough evidence to keep him in custody, said Martine Fontaine of the RCMP.""When he was arrested, he was about to go to Turkey,"" Fontaine said. ""We stopped him as he was about to leave Canada for terrorist actions. He was questioned when he was arrested. We have not been able to determine any real threat at this time.""CNN's John Newsome, Pamela Brown, Jason Hanna, Dorrine Mendoza, Dana Ford, Elise Labott, Jim Sciutto, Pam Brown, Deb Feyerick and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.",61318799,119,155130,1679,689,366849,"1"

276,Lego letter from the 1970s still offers a powerful message to parents 40 years later,"Your account has been created'The urge to create is equally strong in all children… boys and girls'Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileWhen it comes to promoting equality of the sexes, we tend to think that we’ve come a long way in the past 40 years.But a letter that is believed to have been included in a 1974 Lego box set appears to show that the much-loved Danish toy company started to get there a good while before everyone else.According to a post on the online community platform reddit.com, Lego sent a message addressed “To parents” inside the box of assorted building blocks, explaining how “the urge to create is equally strong in all children… boys and girls”.It’s a powerful sentiment that has seen the image shared widely since user fryd_ first posted it on Saturday morning.He said that he came across the letter while playing “with his niece and nephew at their Grandma’s house”, and that it was in a set “from 1973 with a blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house”.Here is the letter in full:“To Parents“The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.“It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.“A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.“The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.”While the image appears to include a copyright from 1974 and the name of a printer in Hamburg used by Lego at the time, the authenticity of the letter could not be independently verified, and a spokesperson for Lego was not immediately available for comment.User fryd_ commented that “it seems like we’ve taken a step backwards” since the letter was written. But others disagreed – with Taliesen13 responding: “That sounds like the moral of The Lego Movie.”Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We will never, ever forgive the Internet for this because we have been forced to look at these damn pictures for days now.ENOUGH.These are photos of the South American Goliath Birdeater, which is the world's largest spider.

Oh, and guess what else it does?!""First, the spider would start rubbing its hind legs against the hairy abdomen,"" he described on his blog upon first encountering the Goliath Birdeater.

302, Day of chaos in the capital leaves soldier and terrorist dead ," A terrorist struck at the heart of the capital Wednesday, gunning down a sentry at the National War Memorial and wreaking havoc on Parliament Hill, where the stone halls echoed with gunfire and ran with blood. Wednesday, Oct. 22 — The stone halls of Parliament Hill echoed with gunfire and were stained with blood Wednesday as a terrorist struck at the heart of the federal government after gunning down a sentry at the National War Memorial.The gunman was shot and killed near the Library of Parliament, according to Ottawa police sources, by House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, a former RCMP officer and the man responsible for security on the Hill.A witness said the gunman, carrying the rifle at his hip, walked deliberately up the west ramp of Centre Block and through the main doors of Parliament as bystanders cowered. It was just before 10 a.m.The gunman walked right past the Centre Block’s Reading Room — where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was meeting with the Conservative caucus — before being confronted and shot.The dead gunman has been identified as Canadian-born Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, a man who had lived in Aylmer, Montreal and Vancouver, and had a criminal record for relatively minor offences in all cities.On Wednesday night, there was a report that Canadian police were rounding up ISIL recruits.Sources suggest the 90 Canadian suspects who joined, or tried to join, ISIS are being rounded up tonight.The fatal showdown in Centre Block followed the cold-blooded slaying of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old reservist standing guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a short distance from Parliament Hill. The sentries’ rifles are not loaded.The ceremonial guard at the memorial normally ends on Labour Day but was extended this year because of important anniversaries connected to the First and Second World Wars.It was the second fatal attack on a Canadian soldier in a week, a shocking turn that has raised questions about whether homegrown radicals are now answering calls for terror attacks in this country.In a televised address to the nation Wednesday night, Prime Minister Stephen Harper labelled the incidents “despicable attacks” and linked them to international terrorism. “In the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had,” Harper said. “But this week’s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.”He vowed that the nation will not be intimidated, nor will it back down from its commitment to wage war against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).“Canada will never be intimidated,” he repeated. “In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts.”Speaking after Harper, NDP Leader Tom Mulcair said the attack was intended to make Canadians “more fearful of their neighbours and less confident in ourselves.”However, “Today’s events have instead only succeeded in drawing us closer and making us stronger,” he said.Witnesses said Cpl. Cirillo, a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, based in Hamilton, was shot twice at close range in front of the War Memorial at 9:52 a.m. He was rushed to The Ottawa Hospital’s Civic Campus but did not survive his injuries.Click to hear raw audio: Dispatchers’, paramedics’ first response. Witnesses said the gunman ran toward Parliament Hill after the shooting; some said he climbed into a parked car on Wellington Street, north of the War Memorial. Others said he commandeered a black Chrysler in front of the East Block and drove it to the base of the Peace Tower.It remained unclear for most of Wednesday whether Zehaf-Bibeau was acting alone or if other shooters were also involved.But late in the day, Ottawa police sources told the Citizen that their working theory is that Zehaf-Bibeau was a lone gunman. Police also confirmed that the gunman used a rifle, not a shotgun, in his attack.Earlier in the day there had been reports of another shooting near the Rideau Centre mall, but those proved to be false.NDP press secretary Greta Levy said she was about to walk down the stairs beneath the Peace Tower just before 10 a.m. when she saw two women in front of her take cover. Someone — she thinks it was a security guard — yelled, “Get down!” Somebody else shouted, “Gun!” Levy said she went to the ground, then pulled her head up from the crook of her elbow.“That’s when I saw him walk up the ramp,” she told the Citizen. “As soon as I saw the gun, I put my head back down.”Zehaf-Bibeau was coming up the west ramp, carrying a rifle at hip level with both hands. He passed right in front of Levy, who had just left the NDP’s caucus meeting. “He was not running,” she said of the gunman, but walking with purpose. He didn’t say a word.Inside Parliament Hill, Zehaf-Bibeau walked into Centre Block where the NDP and Conservative caucuses had convened for 9:15 a.m. meetings. The Liberal caucus was meeting in the basement.Harper was with his party’s caucus when the gunman entered the second floor of Centre Block, but was escorted to safety by his RCMP security team.Across the hall, in the NDP caucus room, about 100 MPs and aides piled tables and chairs in front of the doors after they heard gunshots crash through Centre Block.“A series of gunshots rang out and we realized they were right on the other side of the door,” NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Citizen.Parliament Hill security officers rushed politicians out of the building, Liberal MP Marc Garneau among them. “You could smell the gunpowder,” Garneau said.Security officers pursued the gunman into the Hall of Honour, near the Library of Parliament, and exchanged a hail of gunfire.Vickers fired the shots that killed Zehaf-Bibeau, according to Ottawa police sources. Another guard was wounded in the confrontation. A video shot by Globe and Mail reporter Josh Wingrove showed crouching RCMP officers moving through the main hall toward the Parliamentary library, as the hallway echoed with gunfire.“I am safe and profoundly grateful to Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,” Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino said on Twitter.Justice Minister Peter MacKay offered similar praise: “Thank God for Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our Canadian security forces.”An injured guard was also taken to The Ottawa Hospital with a non-life threatening leg injury, apparently suffered when he attempted to wrest the rifle from Zehaf-Bibeau. That guard has been identified as Samearn Son, a House of Commons constable, who was unarmed. His colleagues are calling him a hero.The Ottawa Hospital also treated two other people who suffered minor injuries in the attack. All of the injured were later released from hospital.—CLICK IMAGE TO ENLARGE — The attack is the most serious security breach of Parliament Hill since 1966, when an unhinged man, Paul Chartier, tried to blow up 10 sticks of dynamite on the floor of the House of Commons. He killed only himself when the explosives detonated before he could throw them.Wednesday’s shooting at the National War Memorial represents the second time this week that a Canadian soldier has come under attack on national soil.On Monday, 25-year-old Martin Rouleau of Saint-Jean-sur-Richeleau, southeast of Montreal, used his car to ram two Canadian soldiers, one of whom later died of his wounds. Rouleau was a convert to Islam whose online postings had become so radical that the RCMP had confiscated his passport.There is speculation the attacks are a reaction from homegrown extremists to the federal government’s decision to join the international coalition battling ISIL in the Middle East. Parliament approved a motion to launch a combat mission against ISIL earlier this month.An ISIL spokesman has called for attacks on Canadians.Wednesday’s attack began on the grounds of the National War Memorial, a site dedicated to all of those who have fought and died for this country.Witnesses said the long-haired gunman, dressed in a dark hoodie, blue jeans and wrapped in a scarf, opened fire on one of the two guards. The gunman used a long rifle from close range.Raivo Nommik, a lighting designer, was walking past the memorial when the shots were fired: “The soldier was shot at close range: It couldn’t have been more than 20 feet.”Construction worker Matthew Blais was working near the East Block when he heard what he described as a “bunch of pops.”“I looked over at the War Memorial and I saw a man with a rifle shooting at innocent people,” Blais said. “We ducked for cover.”Tourist Jan Lugtenborg, of the Netherlands, said he was waiting near the memorial for a tour bus. “Then all of a sudden this happens: I heard four shots. I thought it was a firework,” he said. “We were scared like hell so we ran back.”Blais said he saw the man jump into a car. “He parked right in front of Parliament and ran into the building,” he said.The NDP’s Angus described the wild scene inside the party’s caucus room after the first shots were fired on the Hill.“Security came in fairly fast — I was surprised how fast they came — and I could see from the look in their eyes that they were very worried. We know them. We talk to them every day. They wanted us out of that building.”Angus found himself with a group of MPs ushered outside through the main doors and then to the Promenade Building on Sparks Street. Others scattered into underground corridors.“This is a place we feel welcome, secure and natural,” he said. “We didn’t know what else was going on but with police and army rushing past us we realized we were still in the middle of a firefight.”One woman threw open a second-storey Centre Block window and prepared to jump before construction workers found a ladder and helped her to safety.Liberal MP John McKay was about to head into the Liberal caucus room on the first floor when he heard popping sounds inside the Parliament buildings.“I didn’t think anything of it: I thought it was construction,” he said. “And then the security guards come and say, ‘Up! Everybody up! Everybody out!'”The Liberal MPs were sent out a back door and told to hide behind some statues because security officials were worried that shots could come from Centre Block windows. “We huddled there for a while and then by some means or other we got the all-clear and came down off Parliament Hill,” said McKay.Police set up roadblocks at all bridges, including the Champlain Bridge to the west of downtown, and checked all cars leaving Ontario.Meanwhile, helicopters circled downtown and police snipers took up positions on the roof of the National Gallery of Canada.Security officers told workers in downtown buildings to remain in their offices.City Hall, the Ottawa courthouse, Lisgar Collegiate and the University of Ottawa were among the many institutions that went into emergency lockdown. The NHL postponed an Ottawa Senators game scheduled for Wednesday night and the National Arts Centre cancelled two performances. 1 of 49  You may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen.  After paralyzing much of downtown Ottawa, the security lockdown that had kept politicians, aides and civil servants confined to their offices was finally lifted at 8:30 p.m.At an afternoon news conference, RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the force’s national division, said security on Parliament Hill had been operating at a “medium” level — the same level that has been in place for years. There was no inkling, he said, that an attack was imminent. “If we had known this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it.”Ontario’s Minister of Community Safety, Yasir Naqvi, told reporters that he was informed late last week that the federal government was considering an elevation of its national threat level. “I was also informed at the time that there was no specific or imminent threat posed,” the Ottawa Centre MPP said.Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson asked citizens to think about the slain soldier, Cpl. Cirillo. “Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” he said. “I’m sure I speak for all residents of our city when I extend my heartfelt condolences to the individual who lost his life this morning while standing guard at the National War Memorial in the heart of downtown Ottawa.”Wednesday’s unprecedented attack on Parliament Hill occurred as Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney was preparing to present new anti-terrorism legislation.The government intends to amend the CSIS Act in two ways. One measure would let CSIS work more closely with its allies in the “Five Eyes” spy network, which is made up of Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. A second measure would give CSIS informants the same anonymity that already exists for police sources, who are not subject to cross-examination and can have their identities hidden, even from trial judges.The handful of modern terrorist incidents and major security breaches in Ottawa have largely occurred against foreign embassies and individual diplomats.There are believed to be more than 200 exterior security cameras monitoring the perimeters of all federal buildings. The Hill is also guarded by vehicular barricades and an undisclosed number of uniformed and plainclothes RCMP officers and Commons and Senate security staff. An RCMP Emergency Response Team is believed to be stationed within striking distance.Speaker Andrew Scheer said the House of Commons will be sitting Thursday at 10 a.m., as scheduled.“This sends a clear message of Canada’s resolve to maintain its free and democratic way of life,” he said in a statement.British Prime Minister David Cameron was among the first world leaders to issue a public statement about Wednesday’s attack.“I’m appalled by today’s attack in Ottawa,” he wrote on Twitter. “I offer my full support to Prime Minister Harper and the Canadian people as they deal with this incident.”U.S. President Barack Obama offered his condolences to Cpl. Cirillo’s family and to the Canadian people. “Obviously we’re all shaken by it, but we’re going to do everything we can to make sure we’re standing side by side with Canada during this time,” he said. “Not only is Canada one of our closest allies in the world, but they’re our neighbours and friends.”U.S. Ambassador Bruce Heyman said he was saddened by news of the attack. “The U.S. government condemns this heinous attack, as well as the attack against the Canadian Forces member killed in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu earlier this week,” he said. “We deplore acts of violence toward military, government and law-enforcement officials and stand ready to assist our Canadian partners as they investigate this event.”NDP MP Murray Rankin said he expects Parliament Hill will not be as accessible to Canadians in the future in light of Wednesday’s events. “We cannot eliminate risk,” he said. “But we can take prudent steps to minimize the risk.

Man Walks in South American Rainforest at Night, Sees Spider the Size of a Small Puppy
","NEW FEATURE: VOTE & EARN NEATOPOINTS! Submit your own Neatorama post and vote for others' posts to earn NeatoPoints that you can redeem for T-shirts, hoodies and more over at the NeatoShop!In a story that will haunt my dreams, entomologist Piotr Naskrecki was walking through the rainforest of Guyana at night in search of katydids, as that is what he was studying. He says that typically in his field research, he walks slowly and quietly, so as not to disturb anything. He wears a headlamp, but turns it off on occasion, which he says helps him zone in on the sounds around him. Naskrecki was listening for the distinctive sounds of katydid wings when instead he heard something moving, crushing dry leaves under its feet. In his peripheral vision, he saw what he thought was a large, hairy rodent. It wasn't a large, hairy rodent, however. Instead, it was my very worst nightmare: the largest spider in the world. A South American goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), to be exact. This big, hairy bowl of wrong has legs up to a foot in length, with feet that have hard tips and make clicking sounds as they move along. Its huge fangs are capable of puncturing the skull of a rodent with one clutch. Its size was compared to that of a newborn pup. Naskrecki said that not only did the spider make a hissing sound, rear its front legs and flex its monstrous fangs, but it rubbed its legs against its abdomen, producing a hairy cloud that made Piotr's eyes tear up and burn for several days afterward. (As I've written this and uploaded the images, I've stopped to take deep breaths several times and once glanced at a world map to remind myself how far that species is from me.)Read more about Naskrecki's close encounter with Satan's housepet here.  Images: Piotr Naskrecki

318,Microsoft is reportedly buying 'Minecraft' developer Mojang for $2 billion,"Well, this is rather surprising: Microsoft is in talks to buy Minecraft's developer, Mojang, according to a few different sources. The Wall Street Journal says that the ever loose-lipped ""person familiar with the matter"" has noted the deal is valued at over $2 billion, while reps for both Redmond and the Swedish developer remain mum on the subject. We've reached out to Microsoft and, as expected, were told by a company spokesperson that the outfit doesn't comment on rumors or speculation, as well. If true, this doesn't come too far after outspoken Minecraft mastermind Markus ""Notch"" Persson recently changing his stance on the Facebook/Oculus VR purchase. Maybe he's come around to the idea of no-longer being one of the world's largest indie developers? Hopefully we'll know rather soon. Until then, you'll find us playing with Steve on Xbox One.Update: A few new developments have surfaced, including details on the deal and when it should be completed. The New York Times reports that Microsoft approached Mojang as early as three months ago and the purchase should be finished by the end of this month. Perhaps most interesting though is that should the deal go through, Notch might not stay past six months after the ink has dried. Why? He likely wants to make sure his employees are being well taken care of. According to Bloomberg's sources, Notch (not Microsoft) actually made the approach to Redmond given the positive experience Mojang had bringing Minecraft to the Xbox One. Bloomberg also reports that Notch will help with the transition into ownership, but doesn't plan on staying long beyond that -- this isn't Microsoft forcing him out, it could be him looking to try his hand at something else.Update 2: Reuters hears that Microsoft could unveil the deal (reportedly up to $2.5 billion) on September 15th.Please enter a valid email address",2396228,265,22588,899,129,1178,"1"
319,Involuntary Bioslaughter and Why a Spider is Dead,"Tales of Nature and Photography by Piotr Naskrecki“Hey, where is the spider post?”, you may be asking if you arrived at this page by following one of the thousands of links that sprung up overnight in the online media and social circuits. In the fine tradition of online publishing I took the liberty of pulling a “bait-and-click” switcheroo, and turning the hysteria surrounding the Goliath birdeater’s story into a teaching opportunity. And thus, please bear with me, and read this post to the end (where you will find the original post about the spider) before banging out an angry comment in ALL CAPS.For some reason, probably related to the proximity of Halloween, my blog post about the Goliath birdeater spider received an inordinate amount of attention, and has been republished, reinterpreted, outright stolen, and vilified all over the Internet. This one post on my obscure blog is now receiving in excess of 120,000 unique visits every day, and comments are pouring in. Alas, most of them are somewhat less than positive, and I am beginning to wonder if I really am a “HORRIBLE person” who “will destroy the earth.” (I must admit that some of the trolls were touchingly tactful – they might have said ” F&*K you, a$$hole”, but they modified the foul words as not to offend my sensibility.) But why the vitriol?You see, while talking to a reporter I explained that one of the specimens I describe in the blog had been collected and placed in a museum. This, combined with my comment of having seen this species only a handful of times, triggered a tsunami of self-righteous outrage at my murderous act which, according to the most vocal individuals, is bound to drive this species to extinction. In fact, I really fear for the Smithsonian Institution, this nation’s preeminent natural history collection. If a single spider collected by a scientist causes such an outrage then, surely, the 126 million specimens in its holdings will warrant burning it to the ground and crucifying all scientists working there.But in all seriousness, why was the specimen collected? First, a bit of a background about the expedition to Guyana during which this took place. I was there with a group of biologists and Guyanese students at the invitation of the Ministry of Amerindian Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency of Guyana. Our job was to conduct a comprehensive survey of animals and plants of the newly created Community Conservation Area, train Guyanese students in the methodology of biological surveys, and collect specimens for the Center for the Study of Biological Diversity at the University of Guyana. These specimens are used to both create permanent documentation of the species composition of a never before explored area of the country, and to train a new cadre of scientists and conservation professionals in identification and morphological diversity of organisms. And before you point out various alternative methods of documentation (photographs, sound recordings, non-destructive DNA samples), let me assure you that there is no substitute for the collection of physical specimens.What about this particular spider? As I mention in the post below, Theraphosa blondi is indeed the largest spider in the world (although its legs are not foot long, as some media reported), and thus it makes a perfect specimen for teaching spider morphology. It is also a very common species, not protected or endangered, and collecting of a single individual poses absolutely no threat to its survival (a scientist picking up one spider is no different from a bird doing the same; if a stochastic event such as this can drive a species to extinction then this species is already doomed.) In fact, you can purchase Goliath birdeaters in many pet stores in the US or online for $20-100 a piece. But they are shy and elusive, and thus I was thrilled every time I saw one during a small handful of encounters with this species. Once the animal was properly euthanized and preserved, something that is never done lightly, it was carefully labelled and deposited in the collection in Guyana where to this day it serves as an important teaching tool. And, years from now, the same specimen may provide new data on spider anatomy, genetics, evolution etc. In addition to the spider, we also collected vouchers of 857 other species of animals and plants (excluding birds and large mammals), which are now deposited across various research institutions in Guyana, Venezuela, and the US.Collecting and preservation of physical specimens is an integral, irreplaceable element of biological sciences. There is hardly a branch of biology that does not rely on the examination of organisms’ bodies (the only exception I can think of is ethology, and only some variants of it), be it for the purpose of their identification, understanding of the functions of their respiratory system, or the speed of transmission of neural signals. Museum collections, where specimens are preserved for future scientists, are a special, very important case. There specimens are often deposited not for a particular, clearly defined research project (such as when a geneticist examines thousands of fruit flies to measure the expression of a particular gene). Rather, collections serve as both a documentation of the current state of species composition in a particular time period or an area, or as a library of morphological and genetic diversity across a wide range of species. We cannot anticipate what questions will be asked, and answered, using specimens deposited in such collections. For example, the ban on the use of DDT, a horrible environmental pollutant, was based on the discovery made in ornithological collections that bird egg shells have been getting progressively thinner, thus leading to high mortality of birds, ever since the chemical began to be used. The spread of chytrid fungus that is wiping amphibian species across the globe was understood by examining specimens dating back a hundred years. Closer to my own research, the world’s only cave katydid is now listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List and thus receiving a greater attention from conservationists, because I found 70-year old, unidentified specimens of this species, collected by a scientist who had no idea what a remarkable animal he was catching.Can collecting specimens for scientific research threaten a species’s survival? The short answer is no, there is absolutely no evidence that any scientist has ever driven a species to extinction. Famous New Zealand 19th century ornithologist Walter Buller is sometimes accused of having collected birds to extinction, but a close examination of the numbers of specimens collected by him proves that his work had no impact on the birds’ populations; rather, his bird collection is now a sad repository of species exterminated in New Zealand by moronic, purposeful introduction of alien species and destructive agricultural practices on the islands.And this is the key – species are never lost as a result of scientific collecting, but almost invariably because of the destruction of their habitat, or due to competition from alien species introduced by humans. And this loss of species is happening on an unimaginable scale – by some estimates 16,000 species quietly go extinct every year, some even before scientists have a chance to describe and name them. And this is why if I see something that may be new to science, even if I suspect that it might be rare and threatened, I will collect it and deposit it in a museum. Some years ago I found a new species of katydid in South Africa. I knew that its population was tiny and on the brink of disappearance. In fact, this species is now probably extinct. Not because I collected a few individuals, but because its only population was located in a tiny patch of a native yellowwood forest within a massive pine plantation, a patch that was already being cut down to be replaced by more non-native trees grown for timber. Had I not collected a few specimens of this animal, we would have never known it existed. Now, at least its tombstone has a name – Paracilacris periclitatus, The Endangered Katydid.I could go on and on about why scientific collecting is needed, but I want to mention one last thing. Every single one of us is guilty of involuntary bioslaughter – we kill thousands of organisms without realizing that we do it. Look into the light fixtures of your house or the grill of your car, they are full of dead insects and spiders. That highway that you drive to work – each mile of it equals millions of animals and plants that were exterminated during its construction (and if you live in an area of particularly high endemism, California or New Zealand for example, its construction probably contributed to pushing some species closer to extinction). That tofu that you eat because meat is murder – it probably comes from Brazil, where massive soy plantations stretching from one horizon to another have replaced its once thriving rainforest and led to the disappearance of thousands of species.It is very easy to fixate on an individual case of an organism being deliberately euthanized. We do it because it is convenient emotionally – it is much easier to feel superior when we can point a finger at somebody who does it consciously, even if for a good, justifiable reason, but we don’t like to think about those trillions of animals and plants that we kill by virtue of simply going to a grocery store.And now, enjoy the story of the Goliath birdeater. When I go out at night into the rainforest to search for katydids I don’t like to have any company. Not that I am particularly antisocial, but tracking skittish and cryptic animals is an activity that’s better done alone. I walk slowly, trying not to disturb anything and anybody, slowly scanning the vegetation and the forest floor in the light of my headlamp. Every now and then I turn the light off to fully immerse myself in the ambient sounds of the forest, which often helps me pinpoint a faint trill made by a katydid’s wings. A few years ago I was deep in the rainforest of Guyana doing just that – listening to the sounds of the night in a complete darkness – when I heard the rustle of an animal running. I could clearly hear its hard feet hitting the ground and dry leaves crumbling under its weight. I pressed the switch and pointed the light at the source of the sound, expecting to see a small mammal, a possum, a rat maybe. And at first this is what I thought I saw – a big, hairy animal, the size of a rodent. But something wasn’t right, and for a split second the atavistic part of my brain sent a ping of regret that I didn’t bring any companion with me on this particular night walk. But before that second was over I was lunging at the animal, ecstatic about finally seeing one of these wonderful, almost mythical creatures in person.The South American Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) is the largest spider in the world. For all the arachnophobes out there this is probably a good excuse to pave over large swaths of the Amazonian rainforest, but for the rest of us this species is one of biodiversity’s crown jewels. Although far from being the largest member of the subphylum Chelicerata – this honor belongs to horseshoe crabs – Goliath birdeaters are ridiculously huge for a land arthropod. Their leg span approaches 30 cm (nearly a foot) and they weigh up to 170 g – about as much as a young puppy. They truly are Goliaths, but are they bird eaters? Alas, the truth is a bit less exciting. Although definitely capable of killing small birds, they rarely have a chance to do so while scouring the forest floor at night (however, there is some anecdotal evidence that they may feed on bird eggs if they run across a nest). Rather, they seem to be feeding on what is available in this moist and warm habitat, and what is available is earthworms – lots of them.But how do they get to be so big? Apparently, according to one study (Makarieva et al., Proc. R. Soc. B [2005] 272), it has to do with their metabolic rate, which is lower than in the Goliath birdeater’s relatives. This allows it to function with lower levels of oxygen reaching its tissues and organs than those required by smaller, more active spiders. In other words, the bigger the body the more difficult it is to provide oxygen to all its parts if the metabolic rate is to remain constant. Regardless of the reason, because of its gargantuan size, the Goliath birdeater is probably the only spider in the world that makes noise as it walks. Its feet have hardened tips and claws that produce a very distinct, clicking sound, not unlike that of a horse’s hooves hitting the ground (albeit, admittedly, not as loud). But this is not the only sound this spider makes.Every time I got too close to the birdeater it would do three things. First, the spider would start rubbing its hind legs against the hairy abdomen. “Oh, how cute!”, I thought when I first saw this adorable behavior, until a cloud of urticating hair hit my eyeballs, and made me itch and cry for several days. If that wasn’t enough, the arachnid would rear its front legs and open its enormous fangs, capable of puncturing a mouse’s skull, and tried to jab me with the pointy implements. The venom of a birdeater is not deadly to humans but, in combination with massive puncture wounds the fangs were capable of inflicting, it was definitely something to be avoided. And then there was a loud hissing sound. For a long time the source of the sound was a mystery, but now we know that it is produced by “setal entanglement” – some of the hairs (setae) on the legs are covered with microscopic hooks that scrape against other, feather-like setae, producing the loud warning hiss.A couple of years after my first encounter with Theraphosa blondi I was in South America again, walking alone at night in the rainforest of Suriname. Suddenly my foot brushed against something big and moving, and I nearly tripped. I froze, expecting a snake. “Nah, it’s just another Goliath birdeater. Aren’t you a cutie pie?”Comments are closed. RSS - Posts",1157946,9,4273,801,549,20623,"1"

		Sugarhill Gang Rapper Big Bank Hank Dead at 58	","
			Welcome,		The splashiest voice on “Rapper’s Delight” helped introduce hip hop to a generationReporter
				Big Bank Hank of the pioneering rap group Sugarhill Gang poses for a portrait in 1984.			
				Michael Ochs Archives/Getty			Big Bank Hank, one third of pioneering rap group the Sugarhill Gang, has passed away from cancer at the age of 58. David Mallie, manager of the group’s other members Wonder Mike and Master Gee, confirmed the rapper’s death to Rolling Stone, saying the two surviving members were informed of his death on Tuesday morning.Hank, born Henry Jackson, was best known as the splashiest and most colorful voice on 1979’s “Rapper’s Delight,” the runaway 12-inch that served as rap’s musical ambassador and the record that almost single-handedly brought hip hop culture from the crumbling streets of the South Bronx to the rest of America and beyond.

“So sad to hear about our brothers passing,” his bandmates Wonder Mike and Master Gee said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “The three of us created musical history together with the release of ‘Rapper’s Delight.’ We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace, Big Bank.” 








Thirty-five years later, there still remains some debate as to whether the timeless, 14-minute rhyme spree was technically the first recorded hip-hop song; and controversy still shadows it, as the Sugarhill Gang were mostly New Jersey interlopers borrowing directly from Bronx-born Grandmaster Caz’s rhyme book. But there is no question that the vivid, hilarious tales of dinnertime manners and cuckolded superheroes of “Rapper’s Delight” was suburbia America’s first experience with the nascent culture. It reportedly sold millions upon millions of copies, though Sugar Hill Records, notoriously close to their own accounting, never had it officially certified.Jackson had lived in the Bronx during hip-hop’s inception, attending high school with pioneers like Kool Herc and Coke La Rock and briefly having a managerial role with Caz himself. By 1979, rap music had spent a half-decade as live-performance party music, powered by street lights and youthful energy. However, it had never made it to vinyl until record producer Sylvia Robinson and her son Joey recruited Hank from an Englewood, New Jersey pizza parlor, where he was saving up money after getting a degree in oceanography from Bronx Community College.Covered in pizza dough, he auditioned in the back of Joey’s Oldsmobile 98, causing enough commotion to bring both Master Gee and Wonder Mike over. A late night cipher in Sylvia Robinson’s home on a Friday night formed a group that started recording that Monday. The session, little more than a take or two of the three men rapping over the studio band playing Chic’s “Good Times,” made music history almost instantly.“I mean one minute you’re walking down the street,” Hank said in the book Yes Yes Y’all, “The next minute you’ve got bodyguards and being chased down the street.”Though the “hotel, motel” rhyme was originally floating in the hip-hop atmosphere from Coke La Rock, Hank’s impassioned performance of it on “Rapper’s Delight” marked its first appearance on wax. It’s ultimately been transmuted, via American folk tradition, into a Number Three hit for Chingy (“Holidae In”), a Number Eight hit for Pitbull (“Hotel Room Service”) and bars for everyone from Wu-Tang Clan and 50 Cent to De La Soul and TLC. 








The Sugarhill Gang had their share of success throughout the early Eighties with 1980’s giddy “8th Wonder” and 1981’s crowd-starting “Apache,” still a staple of sporting events the world over. But once Run-D.M.C.’s drum-machine-pummel and shouted delivery exploded in 1983, their disco-inflected sound instantly became dated. The 2011 documentary I Want My Name Back alleges that the Robinsons wouldn’t let the crew evolve with the times.Since they originally disbanded in 1985, Jackson had been estranged from the other two members of the group. He continued using the Sugarhill Gang name alongside Joey Robinson performing as “Master Gee.” This iteration performed at the 2004 BET Awards, the inaugural VH-1 Hip-Hop Honors and Justin Timberlake’s Old School Jam in 2011. Though Wonder Mike himself performed with this version for 11 years, the Robinson-led Sugarhill Gang ultimately invoked years of legal wrangling.But no matter who was on stage, the music of the Sugarhill Gang remained musical bedrock. “Rapper’s Delight” made a memorable appearance in the 1998 film The Wedding Singer and was turned into a high-energy single by Spanish quirk-pop trio Las Ketchup that went Number One in more than 20 countries. Hank’s cry of “Woo-Hah! Got them all in check” also became a hit chorus for Busta Rhymes in 1996.“I see groups that are hot one minute and next time you see them they’re asking if you want a soda with that Happy Meal,” Hank told Maryland’s Herald-Mail in 2013. “We’ve had the ability to transcend generations and that’s a gift. That’s a blessing and I’m grateful for that.”

330,Governor says human remains found in Mexico mass grave had been burned,"Six burial pits discovered on outskirts of Iguala, where violence erupted last weekend and 43 students are missingFirst published on Sun 5 Oct 2014 01.32 BSTSecurity forces investigating the role of municipal police in clashes in this southern city have found burned human remains in mass graves on the edge of town, a lawyer for the families of 43 missing students said on Sunday.Attorney Vidulfo Rosales told the Associated Press said the remains were those of an undetermined number of people, and were unidentified. Relatives of 37 of the missing young people have provided DNA samples over the past several days and will be used to determine if the recovered remains belong to any of the students, the attorney said.The students have been missing since last week in violence that also resulted in six shooting deaths.The governor of Guerrero, Ángel Aguirre, said on Saturday that the victims had been “savagely slaughtered”.A group of protesters blocked a main highway in the state capital of Chilpancingo on Sunday demanding justice in the case. “You took them alive, we want them returned alive,” read a huge planner across the road that links Mexico City with Acapulco.The father of one of the missing students expressed doubt that the remains belonged to the young people. He spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety.Another father, Acapulco street vendor Jesús López, whose 19-year-old son Giovani is among the missing, on Sunday was getting ready to participate in a protest in the Pacific coast resort and said he hoped the remains weren’t those of the students.Other relatives “told us that [the remains] were burned, and that they couldn’t be the kids,” López said. “But we’re really nervous.”Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded on Saturday night when a group of young people from the school protested outside the governor’s Chilpancingo residence. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state authorities told them they would not allow them to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates.The Guerrero state prosecutor Iñaky Blanco did not say on Saturday night how many bodies were in the burial pits uncovered on a hillside on Iguala’s outskirts, and he declined to speculate about whether the dead were the missing students.“It would be irresponsible” to jump to conclusions before tests to identify the bodies, Blanco said. Officials said the federal attorney general’s Office and the National Human Rights Commission had sent teams of experts to aid state authorities in identifying the remains.About 100 soldiers, marines and federal and state police on Saturday cordoned off the area where the grave site was found in the poor Pueblo Viejo district of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200km) south of Mexico City.Blanco said eight more people had been arrested in the case, adding to the 22 Iguala city police officers detained after a police confrontation with student protesters last weekend set off a series of violent incidents in the city.The prosecutor has said state investigators had obtained videos showing that local police arrested an undetermined number of students after the initial clash and took them away.He said some of the eight newly arrested people were members of an organised crime gang, adding that some of them had given key clues leading to the discovery of the mass grave.Blanco said his investigators had found that “elements of the municipal police are part of organised crime”. He also said his office was searching for the Iguala mayor, José Luis Abarca, and had alerted officials across Mexico to be on the lookout for him.The governor had charged earlier in the week that organised crime had infiltrated the city government.Violence is frequent in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.The Aytozinapa Normal school attended by the missing students, like many other schools in Mexico’s “rural teachers college” system, is known for militant and radical protests.State prosecutors have said the first of the recent bloodshed occurred on 26 September when city police shot at buses that had been hijacked by protesting students from a teachers college, killing three youths and wounding 25. A few hours later, unidentified masked gunmen shot at two taxis and a bus carrying a football team on the main highway, killing two people on the bus and one in a taxi.",47280,5982,47546,1122,152,2076,"0"
334,Mexico: Iguala mass grave bodies 'not all of missing students',"Some bodies found in shallow graves near the Mexican town of Iguala are not those of students missing after clashes with police, the state governor says.The 43 students were last seen being pushed into police vans after a protest in Guerrero state on 26 September. ""I can say that some of the bodies, according to the work of forensics experts, do not correspond to the youths,"" said Governor Angel Aguirre.Prosecutors believe police turned over the students to a drug gang.The gang was linked to the family of Iguala's Mayor Jose Luis Abarca Velazquez.He, his wife and his head of security went on leave after the clashes and have not reappeared. A formal search has been launched for them.Mr Aguirre has promised new developments in the investigation over the next few days.""I have big hopes of finding our young students alive. That is why we have now entered a new phase in the search for them,"" he said.The clandestine graves were located in the outskirts of Iguala following an anonymous tip off.Twenty-eight burnt bodies were retrieved from the pits. Forensic experts are still working to identify all of them, said Mr Aguirre. The students all attended a local teacher training college with a history of left-wing activism.Six students were killed in two separate shooting incidents during the protests in Iguala, which lies some 200km (120 miles) south of the capital, Mexico City.But it is not clear whether they were targeted for their political beliefs.Some think that they may have angered a local drug gang called Guerreros Unidos by refusing to pay extortion money.Thousands of people have taken to the streets across Mexico to demand government action to locate the students.President Enrique Pena Nieto went on national television to promise to identify and punish those responsible for the disappearance.He described the incident as ""shocking, painful and unacceptable"" and said there will be ""no impunity"".New mass graves found in Mexico townProtests over Mexico disappearances'No impunity' over Mexico studentsAfghan leader addresses nation as Taliban advanceThe comments come as the Taliban close in on the capital Kabul, with fierce fighting under way.July was Earth's hottest month ever recordedâWorld silently watches this war against womenâ VideoâWorld silently watches this war against womenâ'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car'Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedomsWill Biden's biggest call yet also be his most calamitous?The female Afghan journalist who won't give up.

		Puppy-sized spider with 2-inch fangs found in rainforest	","
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	When scientist Piotr Naskrecki heard rustling in a rainforest, he expected to see a possum or rat.But his curiosity turned to shock when a puppy-sized spider bristled under his flashlight.“When I turned on the light, I couldn’t quite understand what I was seeing,” Naskrecki, an entomologist and photographer at Harvard University’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, told Live Science.Goliath Encounter: Puppy-Sized Spider Surprises Scientist in Rainforest @BearGrylls @midnight http://t.co/53uokAMOlu pic.twitter.com/OVNyAJk2YL— Live Science (@LiveScience) October 20, 2014The South American Goliath birdeater is the world’s largest spider, with a leg span of up to a foot (or the size of “a child’s forearm”) and weighing more than 6 ounces.“Its feet have hardened tips and claws that produce a very distinct, clicking sound, not unlike that of a horse’s hoofs hitting the ground,” Naskrecki wrote on his blog, The Smaller Majority.Naskrecki, who spotted the colossal creature in a South American rainforest in 2012, saw it rub its hind legs against its abdomen, sending out hairs with tiny barbs on them. He said the barbs are “extremely painful and itchy.”The highly venomous arachnid also has 2-inch fangs.But the good news is, even if it bites you, “a chicken can probably do more damage,” Naskrecki said.Naskrecki caught the female and took her back to his lab to study.

            Darren Wilson resigns from Ferguson Police Department
        
","Ferguson Police officer Darren WilsonCiting threats of violence, Darren Wilson, who fatally shot Michael Brown Aug. 9, resigned from the Ferguson Police Department on Saturday.Wilson, 28, whom a St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict in connection with the shooting, had worked for the city’s police department for six years.In a telephone interview Saturday evening, Wilson said he resigned after the police department told him it had received threats that violence would ensue if he remained an employee.“I’m resigning of my own free will,” he said. “I’m not willing to let someone else get hurt because of me.”He said resigning was “the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.”Wilson’s resignation, which was expected, comes after private talks between his representatives and the police department. The grand jury announced its decision in the case Monday.Wilson’s resignation letter reads, in part:“I have been told that my continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance that I cannot allow. For obvious reasons, I wanted to wait until the grand jury made their decision before I officially made my decision to resign. It was my hope to continue in police work, but the safety of other police officers and the community are of paramount importance to me. It is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal.”Wilson, who was paid an annual salary of $45,302, said he has not received a severance package, although he said he may negotiate with the department in hopes of receiving one. He said he’s been told he is not the target of any ongoing internal police investigation.Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson declined to comment.The shooting of Brown, 18, who was unarmed, sparked worldwide protests that continue this weekend. Wilson had been on paid administrative leave since the shooting.Protesters, including Brown’s family members, have accused Wilson of murder in Brown’s death and called for a special prosecutor to pursue charges against Wilson.Anthony Gray, an attorney representing the Brown family, said he believes Wilson was acting merely for his own benefit.“It’s probably in his best interest to sever his ties with the Ferguson community, as well as the Ferguson police department,” Gray said. “I think this incident has severely compromised his ability to police in the way he was paid to do by the city.”Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for Ferguson township who has been active in the protests, said the resignation is too little, too late.“It doesn’t even have the same impact that it would have months ago,” she said. “It would have relieved a lot of anger and the pressure in the streets. It’s been almost infuriating to get to this point and nothing has changed. There was no accountability and sense of responsibility for what has happened.”Bynes said other people involved in the investigation and its outcome — Jackson, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch and St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar — should have either resigned or been held accountable.“Either everybody’s an imbecile, or we have some negligence that’s going on that’s almost criminal,” she said. “So Darren Wilson? He’s the lowest man on the totem pole.”Protester DeRay Mckesson said on Twitter that he and fellow protesters want an arrest, not a resignation, and that protests would continue. “Darren Wilson is not in jail, as he should be,” he said. “His resignation is important but not justice.”The U.S. Justice Department is conducting separate investigations into the killing and into the practices of the Ferguson Police Department. Those investigations are ongoing.On Tuesday, Wilson told ABC News that Brown was the aggressor in the minutes before the shooting. In an account that generally mirrored his testimony before the grand jury, Wilson said Brown had attacked him while the officer sat in his car, then fled. Wilson said he chased after Brown until Brown turned back toward him, refusing Wilson’s commands to stop.As Brown approached, Wilson said, he warned Brown to stop. When he didn’t stop, Wilson repeatedly fired his handgun.“I had to. If I don’t, he will kill me if he gets to me,” Wilson said in the televised interview.Contrary to some reports, Wilson denied he had been paid for the ABC interview. “Absolutely not,” he said Saturday. “I wouldn’t jeopardize my integrity for a dollar.”He expressed gratitude for supporters, some of whom even offered him a home. “It’s been unbelievable the amount of people who have reached out and don’t even know me,” he said.Wilson recently was married to another Ferguson police officer, Barbara Spradling, 36. The couple are expecting their first child. Wilson said the department has asked that Spradling, a 12-year veteran, also resign. He said she has so far declined to do so.He said he had no idea what job he will pursue. “I’ve got to figure out what do we do now,” Wilson said Saturday night. “Right now I would not want to be a cop, but you never know. Only time will tell.”Valerie Schremp Hahn of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.Bennie Currie of Chicago stands with his son Martin Garrett-Currie, 20 near the Ferguson police department on Saturday, Nov. 29, 2014.

		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	Mohammed Islam has since admitted he lied to New York Magazine and did not make any money on the stock market, an Observer interview reveals. New York magazine has retracted the story and apologized.He’s the teen wolf of Wall Street.A kid from Queens has made tens of millions of dollars — by trading stocks on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School, New York magazine reports in its Monday issue.Mohammed Islam is only 17 and still months away from graduating — but worth a rumored $72 million. “The high eight figures,” is as specific as the shy and modest teen would get when asked his net worth.Islam bought himself a BMW but doesn’t have a license to drive it. And he rented a Manhattan apartment, though his parents, immigrants from the Bengal region of South Asia, won’t let him move out of the house yet.Still, the cherubic prodigy is living, and dreaming, large.“What makes the world go round?” Islam asked in the interview, explaining his preference for trading and investment over startups. “Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”Islam and a pair of other young, Wall Street wolf-cub buddies eat regularly at hot spot Morimoto, where they enjoy $400 caviar and fresh-squeezed apple juice.They hope to start a hedge fund in June, after Islam turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license.“Mo’s our maestro,” one of the kids explained.The three pals intend to make a billion dollars by next year. All while attending college. “But it’s not just about the money,” Islam told the mag, which ranked his spectacular success story as No. 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue.“We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.“Like the Koch brothers,” he added, referring to sibling oil magnates Charles and David, worth $40 billion each.Islam’s biggest inspiration, though, is Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge-funder and private asset manager from Connecticut who ranks as the 108th-richest American, according to Forbes.Battered by losses, Jones would jump back in the game again and again. It was a lesson Islam found instructive when, while dabbling in penny stocks at age 9, he lost a chunk of the money he’d made tutoring. Islam swore off trading, realizing, “I didn’t have the balls for it,” he said.We want to create a brotherhood … who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.Fortunately, he turned to studying modern finance, reading up on the titans of trading and ultimately finding inspiration in Jones. “I had been paralyzed by my loss,” Islam remembered of his 9-year-old self.“But [Jones] was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over,” he said.And while Islam still needs to rely on Dad to chauffeur him on inspirational drives past the magnate’s Greenwich mansion, he’s quick to quote from the guru whom he credits with getting him back in the game and making him “who I am today.”“Paul Tudor Jones says, ‘You learn more from your losses than from your gains.’ ”Share Selection",2266261,11104,29247,9167,86,1244,"0"

From the AP: In an almost incomprehensible twist of fate, an Australian woman who lost her brother in the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 learned on Friday that her stepdaughter was on the plane shot down over Ukraine.Kaylene Mann’s brother Rod Burrows and sister-in-law Mary Burrows were on board Flight 370 when it vanished in March. On Friday, Mann found out that her stepdaughter, Maree Rizk, was killed along with 297 others on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which U.S. intelligence authorities believe was shot down by a surface-to-air missile.“It’s just brought everyone, everything back,” said Greg Burrows, Mann’s brother. “It’s just … ripped our guts again.”Read full storyReports that perhaps as many as 100 HIV researchers were on board the downed flight heading to a conference in Australia have shaken the entire profession. Among them was one of the most renowned, Joep Lange.See full stories here and here.Kuala Lampur, Malaysia–Malaysia’s Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai faced repeated questions at a press briefing in Kuala Lumpur today about whether the route that the airline had chosen to fly over rebel-controlled areas of Ukraine was safe.Other airlines such as Qantas had stopped flying those areas, but the minister said that more than a dozen other Asian Pacific airlines had continued to fly it and it was approved by the International Air Transport Association. He said that the plane had not sent a distress call and its systems were in good working order before the deadly crash.Annie GowenEmergency workers at the scene of the crash. (Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters)Under normal circumstances, among the first people to swarm a plane crash site on land are trained professionals. Even under the best of conditions, they’re painstakingly methodical: they seal off the site to prevent tampering, videotape,  examine, preserve parts of the wreckage to be sent off in bits and pieces for analysis. They never know which part of a wing or fuselage might tell the tale, so every small find is crucial.But the circumstances of Thursday’s Malaysia Airlines plane crash were anything but normal. It was obvious from the moment a giant explosion sounded in the distance in eastern Ukraine, spawning smoke that billowed black across the horizon. Among the first to arrive on the scene weren’t “first-responders,” or  clipboard-carrying inspectors, nor professionals trained to deal with such emergencies. They were off-duty coal miners rooting around among the wreck, according to news reports.Terrence McCoyRead the full story here.The Associated Press is reporting that Ukraine rebels claim to have “most” of the data recording devices from the Malaysia Airlines plane that crashed yesterday.Russian news agencies and Reuters were reporting the same thing.The devices could prove critical in determining what happened to the aircraft. There was no word on what the rebels-if indeed they do have the devices-plan on doing with them.Malaysia Airlines is trying to arrange safe access for relatives of victims to the site in eastern Ukraine where its Boeing 777 airliner crashed killing all 298 on board, a spokeswoman for Amsterdam airport said on Friday, according to Reuters.“The relatives, a few hundred of them, are currently being housed in a hotel at Schiphol,” the spokeswoman said. On Thursday, the airline’s European head said it was sending a Boeing 747 to Amsterdam to take relatives to the Ukrainian capital Kiev.Andriy Purgin, a self-proclaimed leader among the Donetsk rebels in Ukraine, told the Russian news agency Interfax Friday morning that separatists are ready to call a truce for two to four days in order to allow Boeing officials and international experts to have unhampered access to the plane crash site.Purgin also told Interfax that rebels would be meeting Friday to discuss that truce with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Ukrainian government.Karoun DemirjianSeparatists have told the OSCE that they will close off the crash site and permit safe access to it for international investigators.In an announcement on its website, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said it had held a video conference with separatists in Donetsk and had been assured that they would provide “safe access and security guarantees” for both national and international crash investigators.The organization also said separatists had committed to closing off the site in preparation for the recovery of bodies.Members of the HIV research community are reeling from the news that many of their own, including world-renowned AIDS researcher Joep Lange, perished when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down Thursday over Eastern Ukraine.The victims were on their way to the International AIDS Conference that begins this weekend in Melbourne, Australia, a trip halfway around the world that necessitated a change of planes in Kuala Lumpur.Joel Achenbach and Ariana ChaSee the full story. The White House expressed concern last night about access for international investigators to the site where Malayasian Airlines Flight 17 went down, saying it is “vital that no evidence be tampered with.”In a statement issued at 10:38 in Washington, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the U.S. was reaching out to member-states of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) with the idea of getting them involved quickly in the investigation.Here’s the full statement:The United States is shocked by the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, and we offer our deep condolences to all those who lost loved ones on board.  We continue to seek information to determine whether there were any American citizens on board.It is critical that there be a full, credible, and unimpeded international investigation as quickly as possible.  We urge all concerned – Russia, the pro-Russian separatists, and Ukraine – to support an immediate cease-fire in order to ensure safe and unfettered access to the crash site for international investigators and in order to facilitate the recovery of remains. The role of international organizations – such as the United Nations and the OSCE in Ukraine – may be particularly relevant for this effort, and we will be in touch with affected nations and our partners in these organizations in the coming hours and days to determine the best path forward.  In the meantime, it is vital that no evidence be tampered with in any way and that all potential evidence and remains at the crash site are undisturbed.  The United States remains prepared to contribute immediate assistance to any international investigation, including through resources provided by the NTSB and the FBI.While we do not yet have all the facts, we do know that this incident occurred in the context of a crisis in Ukraine that is fueled by Russian support for the separatists, including through arms, materiel, and training.  This incident only highlights the urgency with which we continue to urge Russia to immediately take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine and to support a sustainable cease-fire and path toward peace that the Ukrainian government has consistently put forward.Secretary of State John Kerry says the State Department is still reviewing whether any American citizens were on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH 17. Here’s his statement:We are horrified by the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.  There are no words adequate to express our condolences to the families of the nearly 300 victims.  We offer our sympathies and support to the governments of Malaysia and the Netherlands at this difficult time, as well as to all those whose citizens may have been on board.  We are reviewing whether any American citizens were aboard the flight.  The United States Government remains prepared to assist with a credible, international investigation any way we can, and we will continue to be in touch with all relevant partners as we seek the facts of what happened today.Chinese relatives of long-missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 passengers said in a joint statement that Thursday’s crash resurfaced many the questions and feelings they have struggled with since MH370′s disappearance in March. In a statement posted on Weibo, the MH370 Relatives Committee said some people who lost family members on the March flight were watching TV coverage of the MH17 crash “and couldn’t stop crying.” “We have to ask, where is the flight safety? Will every plane ride become scary like a roller-coaster?”Noting the abundance of “different and confusing information about MH17,” the statement continued: “It’s as if the tragedy of MH 370 is happening all over again. We hope relevant countries could work together instead of undermining each other; we hope there would be consistent instead of contradicting information.”Many Weibo users said when they saw “Malaysia Airlines” trending online, they thought MH370 had been found. Instead, many posters asked: Why Malaysia Airlines again? Some online users said that they hoped the incident would bring back  attention for MH370.– William WanThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice on Thursday night prohibiting any U.S. flight operations in the airspace over eastern Ukraine until further notice.This restriction, which was issued in response to the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet, expands an earlier FAA order prohibiting U.S. flights from operating over certain areas in Ukraine. That prohibition was issued in April and said U.S. flights could not operate in the airspace over the Crimean region and near the Black Sea “due to the continuing potential for instability.”The April notice did not cover the airspace where the Malaysia Air flight was shot down.The wreckage of the crashed jet. (Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters)In the hours after a Malaysia Airlines plane crashed in eastern Ukraine, the only thing immediately clear was that nearly 300 people had died. Beyond that, there was confusion, as groups and officials began making claims and counterclaims, accusations and rebuttals, with no unequivocal answers as to who was responsible for shooting down the Boeing 777.The arguments began almost immediately, as the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatist rebels in Ukraine quickly blamed each other for the crashing of Flight 17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. But as comments were posted on social media sites and taken down, and as audio recordings were produced and fingers pointed, things only became more and more murky.U.S. intelligence officials confirmed Thursday that the plane was taken down by a surface-to-air missile. But analysts were still scrambling to determine who actually fired the missile.An official with the Ukrainian government quickly claimed that pro-Russian rebels used a missile system to shoot down the plane. Anton Herashenko, adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, wrote on Facebook that a Buk anti-aircraft missile system — which he said was provided to the rebels by Russian President Vladimir Putin — shot down the plane in an area held by pro-Russian rebels.Like Herashenko, Putin, in televised remarks, also blamed the rebels for the crash. But they denied responsibility and blamed the Ukrainian government, arguing that they lacked the capabilities to shoot down a commercial airliner.“The plane was shot down by the Ukrainian side,” said Serhiy Kavtaradze, a member of the rebels’ security council, according to Interfax. “We simply do not have such air defense systems.”Kavtaradze said the rebels have shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles with “a firing range of only 3,000 to 4,000 meters” — about 10,000 to 13,000 feet — and that passenger jets fly at much higher altitudes.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko denied that the government shot down the plane, saying that Ukraine’s armed forces “did not take action against any airborne targets,” according to the Associated Press.While rebels in eastern Ukraine denied having the rocket launcher needed for such an attack, journalists with the Associated Press had reported seeing a similar weapon in this region earlier in the day. The Buk missile system is capable of reaching a plane expected to be flying between 33,000 and 37,000 feet.And in a conversation between President Obama and Putin on Thursday morning discussing recent U.S. sanctions against Russia, Obama noted “extensive evidence that Russia is significantly increasing the provision of heavy weapons to separatists in Ukraine,” the White House said in a statement.Adding to the confusion, the Ukraine Security Service later released a recording of what it claimed were intercepted phone calls capturing pro-Russian separatists discussing shooting down a plane. The Washington Post could not independently verify the recording or any of the individuals on it. (Three Russian language speakers working for The Washington Post have verified the English translation used here.)The recording appears to be a composite of three separate conversations; at one point, a voice on the recording identified by the Ukrainian intelligence agency says either “we have just shot down a plane” or “they have just downed the plane.” In another portion of the recording, one voice describes seeing “lots of corpses of women and children” on the ground.“They say on TV it’s an AN-26 transport plane, but they say it’s written Malaysia Airlines on the plane,” the voice said. “What was it doing on Ukraine’s territory?”Another posting that appeared to comment on the plane appeared on a social media site before being shot down. Not long after the plane went down, a social media page frequently attributed in Ukrainian media to Igor Girkin, a Russian citizen who describes himself as a rebel military leader, seemed to post something that appeared to claim responsibility for the downed plane.“We have just shot down an AN-26 plane in the Torez region, it is lying somewhere near the Progress mine,” read the post at 5:50 p.m. Moscow time on the social media site VKontakte. “We have warned emphatically: Do not fly in ‘our sky.’”The Washington Post has not confirmed that the posting was created by Girkin or someone associated with the rebels. The post, which appeared to suggest that the pro-Russian forces thought the aircraft was a Ukrainian military transport plane, claimed to offer “video confirmation” of the crash. However, after news emerged that the downed plane was a commercial airliner, the post was removed.Ukrainian officials also said that two other planes were shot down earlier in the week: A Ukrainian air force jet, which they said was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a Russian plane on Wednesday; and a military transport plane, which they said was shot down Monday by a missile fired from Russian territory.World leaders and politicians quickly reacted to the crash, offering condolences and assistance, but some reactions were muddled based on the confusion. Sen. John McCain (R) told reporters Thursday afternoon that “the culpable party here is Putin,” though he admitted that his comments were based solely on news reports, which at the time were inconclusive and lacking many details.This confusion is likely to linger, because any investigation is expected to be complicated by the fighting in the region. A Ukrainian regional official said after the crash that rebels did not allow the government access to the plane for the first hour, while Russian officials are insisting that they have a right to be included in any investigation of the crash. And pro-Russian separatists told Interfax they had found “black box” flight recorders at the crash scene, saying later that they planned to give them to officials in Moscow.Meanwhile, the plane was filled with Dutch, Malaysian, Australian and Indonesian citizens, among others, which meant that the crash transcended the Ukrainian-Russian border and touched countries around the world. So in addition to Russian officials wanting to be part of the investigation, other countries could also insist on being part of the efforts to understand the crash.Karoun Demirjian and Natasha Abbakumova in Moscow and Abby Phillip, Isabelle Khurshudyan and Kirill Kozionov in Washington contributed to this report.RELATED: Flights are avoiding the airspace over Ukraine.Members of the international HIV research community who are heading to Melbourne for a huge International AIDS Conference beginning this weekend are in a state of shock and grief after hearing reports that a prominent European researcher and at least several other delegates perished when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down Thursday over eastern Ukraine.“The International AIDS Society (IAS) today expresses its sincere sadness at receiving news that a number of colleagues and friends en route to attend the 20th International AIDS Conference taking place in Melbourne, Australia, were on board the Malaysian Airlines MH17 flight that has crashed over Ukraine earlier today,” conference officials said in a statement. “At this incredibly sad and sensitive time the IAS stands with our international family and sends condolences to the loved ones of those who have been lost to this tragedy.”The identities of the victims have not been confirmed by the airlines.“There are Australians who would have planned to be at the airport tomorrow night to greet friends and family â amongst them, some of the world’s leading AIDS experts,” Australian opposition leader Bill Shorten told Parliament Friday morning, according to the Associated Press. “The cost of this will be felt in many parts of the world.”Former U.S. President Bill Clinton is to deliver an address at next week’s AIDS conference, which brings together thousands of scientists and activists from around the world to discuss the latest developments in HIV and AIDS research.House of Representatives Speaker Bronwyn Bishop called for a moment of silence in parliament to honor the victims, adding that she was scheduled to address the AIDS conference on Monday.“I know there will be many empty spots,” Bishop said. “And I think that what we’re doing is mourning with all of the world and all that had been lost. And we want to see justice but in a measured way.”One delegate described the group that had already gathered in Australia as being devastated. About 14,000 delegates are expected at the conference.AIDS research has been marked by previous aviation disasters. Irving Sigal, a molecular biologist who helped develop the drugs used to treat HIV, died in the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. Ten years later, prominent researchers Jonathan Mann and Mary Lou Clements-Mann died in the crash of Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia.– Joel AchenbachThere were 298 people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 when it was shot down Thursday, not 295 as the airline originally said.In announcing the new number in a statement, the airline said there were three infants on the plane:As opposed to the earlier statement, the flight was carrying a total number of 298 people – comprising 283 passengers including three infants of various nationalities and 15 crew of Malaysian nationality. Some of the nationalities of the passengers are yet to be determined.The airline said in the statement that all of its European flights “will be taking alternative routes avoiding the usual route” — though, it added, Flight 17′s usual route “was earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. International Air Transportation Association has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions.”In its statement, the airlines also released details about the nationalities of most of the passengers and crew members who were aboard Flight 17.Ukraine’s intelligence service claimed Thursday that it intercepted a recording of several separatists and a Russian military intelligence officer conferring about the Malaysia Airlines plane that was shot down.The recording — an apparent composite of three separate conversations — was broadcast on Russian radio station Ekho Moskvi and published online by the Kyiv Post and also on the Ukrainian Security Service’s website and YouTube page.The Washington Post could not independently verify the recording or the individuals identified in it. However, three Russian language speakers working for The Washington Post independently verified the English translation used here.One voice on the tape — identified by the Ukrainian intelligence agency as Igor Bezler, one of the leaders in the pro-Russian separatist movement in eastern Ukraine — says either “we have just shot down a plane” or “they have just down the plane.” (This Russian statement could be translated in either way in the context of this conversation.)The middle portion of the video is a conversation between two different people described as “terrorist” [sic] in the English subtitles produced by the Ukrainian intelligence agency. They discuss the downing of the plane, saying it was shot down by a group of insurgents, referred to as “Cossacks,” who were located near the Chernukhin checkpoint, which is 15 miles north of the crash site, according to the Associated Press.“Well, what do you have there?” says a person, identified in the Security Service video as “Greek.”“In short, it was 100 percent a passenger aircraft,” answers another voice, calling from the crash scene and identified in the video as “Major.”Later in the video, in a separate conversation, a militant describes the scene at the crash site:“There are lots of corpses of women and children. The Cossacks are out there looking at all this… They say on TV it’s an AN-26 transport plane, but they say it’s written Malaysia Airlines on the plane. What was it doing on Ukraine’s territory?”Karoun Demirjian and Natasha Abbakumova in Moscow and Isabelle Khurshudyan and Kirill Kozionov in Washington contributed to this report.President Obama spoke with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Thursday to discuss the Malaysian Airlines plane crash. Obama “assured him that U.S. experts will offer all possible assistance immediately,” according to the White House, which said Poroshenko “welcomed the assistance.”Head to Post Politics for more.",606309,364,7595,755,258,8984,"0"

399,"42 Million Dead In Bloodiest Black Friday Weekend On Record","NEW YORK—According to emergency personnel, early estimates indicate that more than 42 million Americans were killed this past weekend in what is now believed to be the bloodiest Black Friday shopping event in history.First responders reporting from retail stores all across the nation said the record-breaking post-Thanksgiving shopping spree carnage began as early as midnight on Friday, when 13 million shoppers were reportedly trampled, pummeled, burned, stabbed, shot, lanced, and brutally beaten to death while attempting to participate in early holiday sales events.Law enforcement officials said the bloodbath only escalated throughout the weekend as hordes of savage holiday shoppers began murdering customers at Wal-Mart, Sears, and JCPenney locations nationwide, leaving piles of dismembered and mutilated corpses in their wake.“The level of bloodshed this year was almost beyond imagination—no prior Black Friday could have prepared us for this,” said National Guard commander Frank Grass, talking to reporters in front of the still-smoldering remains of a local Best Buy that was burned to the ground Saturday. “We had fire trucks, police cruisers, and guardsmen stationed at multiple locations, but it was useless. At the moment, hundreds of thousands of American shoppers are still unaccounted for, and we expect $2 billion in damage has been wrought upon our cities. ”“The stench of death is unbearable,” a tearful Grass added. “Simply unbearable.”As the weekend of sales drew to a close, ambulances could be seen circling the now empty and completely ravaged shopping complexes as they searched for signs of life, while clean-up crews worked to clear the rubble, overturned cars, and large pools of blood from local Kohl’s and Macy’s parking lots.The White House issued an official response, stating, “We mourn the deaths of those 42 million American shoppers who tragically lost their lives this Black Friday.”Survivors of the deadly holiday sales event said that while the weekend began as a chance to “get in on some unbeatable post-Thanksgiving deals,” it quickly escalated into a merciless, no-hold-barred fight to the death.“At some point in time we all stopped caring about the deals and the holiday shopping and were pretty much just out for blood,” said Dana Marshall, 37, a Target shopper who suffered seven broken ribs and a cracked sternum while fighting two other customers for a discounted Nikon digital camera. “I remember just sitting on top of a woman and smacking her head with a DVD player until her face was completely unrecognizable.

406,Ex-Marlboro man dies from smoking-related disease,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — When it came to portraying the rugged western outdoorsman who helped transform a pack of filtered cigarettes into the world's most popular brand, Marlboro Man Eric Lawson was the real deal.Ruggedly handsome, the actor could ride a horse through the wide-open spaces of the Southwest, from Texas to Colorado to Arizona or wherever else the Phillip Morris tobacco company sent him to light up while representing a true American icon, the cowboy. And he really did smoke Marlboro cigarettes, as many as three packs a day.Lawson was still smoking in 2006 when he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He died of the disease at his home in San Luis Obispo on Jan. 10. He was 72.For three years in the late 1970s and early '80s, Lawson portrayed one of the most iconic figures in both advertising and popular culture.And for the past several years, Lawson had spoken out fiercely about the hazards of smoking, doing a public service announcement for the American Cancer Society in the 1990s, years before he was able to bring himself to quit.""He tried to speak to the kids, telling them don't start smoking,"" his wife, Susan Lawson, told The Associated Press. ""He already knew cigarettes had a hold on him.""Exactly how many rugged he-man types portrayed the Marlboro Man over the years isn't clear, although Lawson was one of dozens.His wife said Monday he was friendly with some of the others, including Wayne McLaren, a former rodeo rider who died in 1992 of lung cancer that he blamed on his lifelong smoking habit.Like Lawson, McLaren spent his final years advocating against smoking. So did David McLean, who died in 1995 of lung cancer that he also blamed on smoking. He was 73.As the Marlboro Man, Lawson and the others helped turn a brand that had once been marketed as a mild women's cigarette into the ultimate symbol of American machismo.Not every Marlboro Man was a cowboy — there were also pilots, hunters, weight lifters, miners and other macho characters. But cowboys were clearly the most popular and the most often used.""The most powerful — and in some quarters, most hated — brand image of the century, the Marlboro Man stands worldwide as the ultimate American cowboy and masculine trademark, helping establish Marlboro as the best-selling cigarette in the world,"" the industry publication Advertising Age declared in 1999.Part of the reason for the brand's success was that Phillip Morris' ad agency went to great pains to track down real cowboys, who not only looked rugged but could really do things like rope and ride.""He had to go out and ride, he needed to prove himself as a cowboy,"" Lawson's wife recalled of her husband's audition to become a Marlboro Man.By the time he got the job in 1978, cigarette advertising was no longer allowed on U.S. television, so Lawson appeared in print and billboard ads. His wife still has one from Time magazine.The ads, often filmed in stunning, picturesque settings in the West always emphasized that it was a real man, not in any way a wimp, who smoked a Marlboro.Lawson was perfect for the part. The veteran actor had appeared in such Western films and TV shows as ""The Shooter,"" ''Walker, Texas Ranger,"" ''Tall Tale,"" ''Bonanza: Under Attack"" and ""The A Team.""Later, he also became a perfect role model who made a difference in the lives of the people he kept from smoking simply by pointing out what it did to him, said John Seffrin, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society.""That's important,"" Seffrin said, ""because people stop and think if that happens to Eric Lawson it could happen to me.""In addition to his wife, Lawson is survived by six children, 18 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.___Associated Press Writer Daisy Nguyen contributed to this story.The former president's question on so-called Reinstatement Day got the treatment on Twitter.The mother of the two brothers accused of killing a Chicago police officer was arrested at a hospital as she […] The post Mom of two sons accused of killing Chicago police officer arrested appeared first on TheGrio.The MyPillow guy just pulled out a new excuse for failing to show his supposed evidence of 2020 election fraud.King was tough — he once allegedly grabbed an official by the throat and was suspended.Piling on the pounds in middle age is an affliction familiar to many, but the common excuse of a slowing metabolism is no longer a valid excuse, according to a new study.The actress appears in the trailer for St. Vincent's The Nowhere Inn.Divorce is never an easy situation, especially when it comes to friends, because they often have to pick sides.

408,Pope Francis declares evolution and Big Bang theory are real and God is not 'a magician with a magic wand',"Francis goes against Benedict XVI’s apparent support for 'intelligent design' - but does hail his predecessor’s 'great contribution to theology'Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileThe theories of evolution and the Big Bang are real and God is not “a magician with a magic wand”, Pope Francis has declared.Speaking at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, the Pope made comments which experts said put an end to the “pseudo theories” of creationism and intelligent design that some argue were encouraged by his predecessor, Benedict XVI.Francis explained that both scientific theories were not incompatible with the existence of a creator – arguing instead that they “require it”.“When we read about Creation in Genesis, we run the risk of imagining God was a magician, with a magic wand able to do everything. But that is not so,” Francis said.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGetty“The Big Bang, which today we hold to be the origin of the world, does not contradict the intervention of the divine creator but, rather, requires it.“Evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve.”The Catholic Church has long had a reputation for being anti-science – most famously when Galileo faced the inquisition and was forced to retract his “heretic” theory that the Earth revolved around the Sun.Yet more recently, Benedict XVI and his close advisors have apparently endorsed the idea that intelligent design underpins evolution – the idea that natural selection on its own is insufficient to explain the complexity of the world. In 2005, his close associate Cardinal Schoenborn wrote an article saying “evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense – an unguided, unplanned process – is not”.Giovanni Bignami, a professor and president of Italy’s National Institute for Astrophysics, told the Italian news agency Adnkronos: “The pope’s statement is significant. We are the direct descendents from the Big Bang that created the universe. Evolution came from creation.”Giulio Giorello, professor of the philosophy of science at Milan’s University degli Studi, told reporters that he believed Francis was “trying to reduce the emotion of dispute or presumed disputes” with science.Despite the huge gulf in theological stance between his tenure and that of his predecessor, Francis praised Benedict XVI as he unveiled a bronze bust of him at the academy's headquarters in the Vatican Gardens.“No one could ever say of him that study and science made him and his love for God and his neighbour wither,” Francis said, according to a translation by the Catholic News Service.“On the contrary, knowledge, wisdom and prayer enlarged his heart and his spirit. Let us thank God for the gift that he gave the church and the world with the existence and the pontificate of Pope Benedict.”Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It seems you need to apply a lot of force. Other tech journalists have said iPhone 6 Plus users should wear looser jeans, but you can chalk this up as a victory for the smaller, more practical 4.7-inch iPhone 6.Check out the video:",3406256,389,23189,990,204,9460,"0"

They also convened to, among other things, prepare for the imminent court decision by issuing 'rules of engagement' for police there for crowd control, the New York Times reports.Many of the the high-profile protesters met with President Obama and discussed the matter November 5, including Reverend Al Sharpton. It was a meeting the Gateway Pundit notes was not included on the president's daily schedule.Sharpton told the Times that Obama urged the group to 'stay on course.'Scroll down for video Preparing for the inevitable: A demonstrator marches through the streets during a protest marking the 100th day since the shooting death of Michael Brown in St. Louis, Missouri on November 16Making a statement: A demonstrator holds a sign that reads, End White Supremacy, as he lays on the ground during a protest over the death of Michael Brown on November 16, 2014 in St. Louis, MissouriChilling: Snow falls on a memorial on the 100th day since the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson. A crowd of a couple hundred demonstrators took to the streets of St. Louis on Sunday'[Mr. Obama] was concerned about Ferguson staying on course in terms of pursuing what it was that he knew we were advocating. He said he hopes that we're doing all we can to keep peace.'A crowd of a couple hundred demonstrators, angry about the fatal August shooting took to the streets of St. Louis on Sunday, briefly blocking a major intersection in protest.Dozens of people lay down in the street outside of a downtown theater hosting a film festival, pretending to have been shot by other demonstrators playing the role of police officers in an action intended to evoke the memory of 18-year-old Brown, who died 100 days ago in front of his home in the suburb of Ferguson.On course: Rev. Al Sharpton revealed the President secretly met with Ferguson protestorsMarchers went on to briefly block a major intersection near Washington University and the event ended without any of the violence that was seen in Ferguson following Brown's shooting death by police officer Darren Wilson.'This is a mature movement. It is a different movement that it was in August. Then it just had anger, justifiable anger,' said DeRay McKesson, a 29-year-old protest leader, as wet snow fell on the city. 'Now we are organized. We are strategizing. And we are going to bring our message to the power structure.'A grand jury, sitting in the county seat of Clayton,Missouri, is currently deliberating whether to bring criminal charges against Wilson. Many residents and officials in the region fear another wave of rioting similar to the one in August that led to the burning out of multiple businesses if the grand jury decides not to charge Wilson.'We are bracing for that possibility. That is what many people are expecting. The entire community is going to be upset,' if Wilson is not indicted, said Jose Chavez, 46, a leader of the local Latinos en Axion group. There have been conflicting witness accounts of the shooting, with some saying that Brown had his hands up in surrender while others have described it as a struggle between Brown and Wilson.Ferguson and its surroundings have been fairly quiet the last few days as both police and protesters plan their response to the grand jury's report.'We've decided not to wait for that decision. We've decided to get started,' said Rockit Ali, a 22-year-old organizer of Sunday's demonstration, who marched in a Spider-Man mask.While Sunday's event had been planned as a nonviolent action, Ali said that violence could not be ruled out if the grand jury finds Wilson without fault.Preparation: Demonstrators lay on the ground in a mock death protest of the shooting of Brown.

The rioting and looting, while I didn't participate in it, was necessary. Without it we would not be standing here today,' Ali said. 'There is no revolution without violence.'From Boston to Los Angeles, police departments are bracing for large demonstrations when the grand jury decides.The St. Louis County grand jury, which has been meeting since August 20, is expected to decide this month whether Officer Darren Wilson is charged with a crime for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown after ordering him and a friend to stop walking in the street on August 9.For some cities, a decision in the racially charged case will, inevitably, reignite long-simmering debates over local police relations with minority communities.'It's definitely on our radar,' said Lt. Michael McCarthy, police spokesman in Boston, where police leaders met privately Wednesday to discuss preparations. 'Common sense tells you the timeline is getting close. We're just trying to prepare in case something does step off, so we are ready to go with it.'In Los Angeles, rocked by riots in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers in the videotaped beating of Rodney King, police officials say they've been in touch with their counterparts in Missouri, where Gov. Jay Nixon and St. Louis-area law enforcement held a news conference this week on their own preparations.A St. Louis County town that neighbors Ferguson, Missouri, is warning residents to prepare for potential unrest that may follow the grand jury announcement in the Michael Brown case.Berkeley officials passed out flyers this week urging its 9,000 residents to be prepared just as they would in the event of a major storm, with plenty of food, water and medicine on hand in case they're unable to leave home for several days.The flyer says Lambert Airport will be protected by the National Guard, but airport spokesman Jeff Lea says that's wrong. Lea says the airport will continue to be protected by its own security force.Brown was killed Aug. 9 by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson. A grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge Wilson.A suburban St. Louis school district says schools will get early notice once the Ferguson grand jury reaches a decision.A letter on the Hazelwood School District's site from Superintendent Grayling Tobias says the St. Louis County prosecutor's office will alert districts 24 hours before the media if the decision is on a weekend.If it's a weekday, Tobias says districts will learn three hours before media, so students can be sent home before potential protests. District spokesman Jack Wang says districts won't be told what the decision is.The grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge white Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old who was black and unarmed.A prosecutor's office spokesman didn't return messages seeking comment.Indict America: Protesters made some startling statements as they awaited the grand jury decision'Naturally, we always pay attention,' said Cmdr. Andrew Smith, a police spokesman. 'We saw what happened when there were protests over there and how oftentimes protests spill from one part of the country to another.'In Las Vegas, police joined pastors and other community leaders this week to call for restraint at a rally tentatively planned northwest of the casino strip when a decision comes.In Boston, a group called Black Lives Matter, which has chapters in other major cities, is organizing a rally in front of the police district office in the Roxbury neighborhood the day after an indictment decision.In Albuquerque, New Mexico, police are expecting demonstrations after having dealt with a string of angry protests following a March police shooting of a homeless camper and more than 40 police shootings since 2010.Philadelphia police spokesman Lt. John Stanford said he anticipated his city will see demonstrations, regardless of what the grand jury returns.But big-city police departments stressed they're well-equipped to handle crowds. Many saw large but mostly peaceful demonstrations following the 2013 not-guilty verdict in the slaying of Florida teen Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman. In New York, hundreds of protesters marched from Union Square north to Times Square, where a sit-in caused gridlock.The New York Police Department, the largest in the nation, is 'trained to move swiftly and handle events as they come up,' spokesman Stephen Davis said.In Boston, McCarthy said the city's 2,200 sworn police officers have dealt with the range of public actions, from sports fans spontaneously streaming into the streets following championship victories to protest movements like Occupy.'The good thing is that our relationships here with the community are much better than they are around the world,' he said.

418,Graffiti Artist Banksy Arrested In London; Identity Revealed,"America's Shittiest Independent News SourceA mugshot taken by London Police today of Paul Horner AKA BanksyLondon, England — The elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. After hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed.The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. The BBC has confirmed this information with Banky’s PR agent Jo Brooks along with Pest Control, a website that acts as a handling service on behalf of the artist.London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run.“We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said. “We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”Horner was arrested by London Police in Watford, a town and borough in Hertfordshire, England, about 17 miles northwest of central London.The graffiti artist that goes by the name Space Invader told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of Banksy’s identity.“He’s just doing art, spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how. That is what he was doing and I hope that is what he’ll continue to do,” Invader said. “For the London Police to setup some 24-hour task force just to catch Banksy is ridiculous. I hope we hear plenty of noise from the good tax-paying citizens of London about this.”After today’s arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with Banksy’s arrest. CNN spoke with John Hawes who is a project manager for Banksy says he is worried that charges could be brought against him also.“If they spent this many man-hours and brought this many charges against Banksy, I can’t imagine that he’ll be the only one to go down in all of this,” Hawes said. “All the beauty Paul Horner brought to this world, unfortunately the London Police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up. It’s such a shame.”Banksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.Police apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a Christian organization named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.“I’m just happy to be a part of this whole thing,” Fappy told CNN. “I’m not familiar with this Banksy character, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard of it, but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of self-rape, then that is a good thing. Hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the Devil’s doorbell. Hopefully, God willing, one day, masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the Devil’s playground. To find out more about finding a cure to this deadly disease, please visit STOP Masturbation NOW.”Local resident 27-year old Matthew Williams told reporters he was disgusted when he heard news of the arrest.“What a waste of taxpayers money. Wouldn’t it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence ? What harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork? The counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash.” Williams continued, “This is just another move by the Five-Oh to crush anything good and free. People need to work out what side they’re on and if they’re on the side of beauty and freedom, they need to start fighting back. There are simply not enough heroes like Banksy to do it for you. I hope this blows up in the cops’ faces and the rest of the government as well.”“People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.F*ck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.”A black and white image created from the documentary “Exit Through The Gift Shop” along with an autograph from Banksy.In 2011, Banksy was a no-show to accept his Oscar for his documentary Exit The Gift Shop, though his artwork was seen all over Hollywood in days leading up to the awards.As soon as news of the arrest was made, the City of London Police say they began receiving dozens of phone calls from people either claiming to be Banksy, or claiming to be with him. As of 6 PM London time, hundreds of people were gathered outside the London Police Department chanting “I’m Banksy!” and holding signs demanding his release. Various local news stations have reported witnessing the crowd parting for a blind woman who attempted to turn herself into authorities claiming that she was in fact the real Banksy.Horner was born in Liverpool is a city in Merseyside, England, on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary. Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of graffiti, public vandalism, criminal mischief, public indecency, resisting arrest, money laundering, criminal conspiracy and racketeering. More charges may follow. For anyone with more information on criminal charges that could be used against Horner, London working alongside the United States have setup a 24-hour hotline at (785) 273-0325.Enter your email address to subscribe to National Report and receive notifications of new posts by email.

420,Cpl. Nathan Cirillo dreamed of becoming full-time soldier,"The opening shots that began a devastating day on Parliament Hill killed a Hamilton reservist who dreamed of being a full-time soldier and deprived his kindergarten-aged son of his father. Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, was shot while on honorary guard at the National War Memorial. Ottawa Police announced hours after the shooting that the soldier shot at the memorial had died.He would later be identified as Cirillo, a reservist from Hamilton serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada regiment. Cirillo died a short time after the attack despite frantic efforts to revive him at the base of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.Lt.-Col. Lawrence Hatfield of the Argylls made a brief statement on Wednesday night to reporters and members of the public who gathered outside the James Street armoury.""The regiment wishes to express its sincere condolences to the family of Cpl. Cirillo as well as to express our thanks that's been demonstrated by the support of Canadians across this country,"" he said. ""Cpl. Cirillo was a very proud member of the Argylls and the Highlanders of Canada. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, and we hope that Canadians share that with us.""Back in East Hamilton, the news spread through his extended the family. A distraught uncle, Jim Cirillo, answered the door to his Barton Street East home with swollen eyes, a TV locked on the 24-hour news cycle of the unfolding events, and a computer opened to a picture of his nephew, Nathan. Between tears, he pointed at the picture on the screen. He said his sister-in-law and mother to Nathan, Kathy, couldn’t believe the news.“She's saying she doesn't believe it … She went on the internet and she saw it and she … I don't know how she didn't pass out.“She's just completely broken, broken right now.""Jim Cirillo said Nathan and his two sisters weren't ""dealt a good hand,"" with a difficult divorce splitting up their parents.""And now for him to get shot and pass away, I don't know if life is fair … he didn't deserve that,"" he said. ""I don't know how someone could have picked him out and do that.""Along with Hamilton Police Chief Glenn De Caire, Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina visited the family and told reporters outside the armoury where Cirillo joined as a cadet when he was 13 years old that he expects the fallen soldier to have a funeral with “full service honours.”""It was very sad but there was some comfort in being with Chief De Caire, who has experience with dealing with sudden loss of life,"" Bratina said. ""We had some hugs and tears. One young boy walked in and said to his aunt, I believe it was, 'I saw you crying.'""Bratina said Cirillo had two sisters, and was part of ""a typical Hamilton family. Beautiful home. Clean as a whip. Pictures of Nathan and his two sisters on the wall. It was the kind of place that any of us would feel right at home going into.""Jim Cirillo confirmed that Nathan's father has been in Costa Rica for several years. Nathan had tried to reconnect with his father a few years ago, and had recently reconnected with his mother. She will be taking care of his son, Marcus, who just entered kindergarten, and his two dogs. The child's mother, who had the baby while Cirillo was still a teenager, is no longer in the picture.Cirillo was a personal trainer, former Good Life fitness employee and bouncer at a downtown Hamilton bar, Club Absinthe.Manager Billy Pozeg said he would often come straight from the armoury in his fatigues, and change at the club before his shifts, joking he would go from one service job to another. He added Cirillo would bring up the mood in a room with a smile as wide as his shoulders, adding his dream was to be a full-time member of the military.His pictures posted on Facebook and Instagram show a man always smiling, who played guitar and loved his two large dogs. He posed for tourists shortly before he was attacked. A source who asked not to be identified told CBC News in Hamilton that members from the unit have all been ordered not to speak about the incident.""They are now all on communication lockdown,"" the source said. ""They’ve been told to put their phones away and all bases are all locked down.""Cirillo's friend, Marie Michele, has been trying to make sense of the news all day. She first realized Cirillo had been shot when pictures of paramedics trying to save his life was shown on television Wednesday morning.""I saw his face and it was him,"" Michele said. ""That's how I found out it was Nathan. ""Nathan was a good man. He would give anything to anyone,"" she said. ""He was there for everyone.""Police have set up a roadblock around the Cirillo family's home in east Hamilton while they decide who will be their spokesperson.Members of Canada’s Muslim community offered condolences to the family, condemning the attack.“The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at Canada categorically and unequivocally condemns this morning’s terror attacks on the Canadian Parliament and the National War Memorial as well as on the Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec,” the organization said in a statement released Wednesday. “These acts of terror have no basis in any religion.”The Argylls are an infantry unit of the Canadian Forces primary reserves within 31 Canadian Brigade Group. It is one of the largest army reserve units in the country with over 250 soldiers.Retired Col. Geordie Elms said Hamilton’s Highland regiment served in the first two World Wars, as well as Afghanistan, contributing more manpower than any other militia in Ontario. He knew it was an Argyll when he saw the uniform.“It was terrible anyway. Then it became clear where this had taken place. That’s a ceremonial duty that goes to commemorating our history,” Elms said. “It’s tragic that it’s one of our Argylls.”On average, Elms said a reservist dedicates one night a week and one weekend a month to it. Every year, there’ll be a concentrated exercise where it might be a week or 10 days.Elms said the greatest single force of reservist recruits is still students, because of the nature of the work and the potential to do training during the summer period. “For this particular task to guard the War Memorial and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, they would have put out a notice and he would have answered it,” Elms said. “It’s an honour and a privilege to do that duty, just as it would be if you were to be part of the ceremonial guard on Parliament Hill in the summertime. It’s a sought-after task. It’s not a task they have any trouble filling.”The soldiers who were guarding the National War Memorial are part of a ceremonial guard, and full-time and part-time soldiers are rotated through duty on an hourly or bi-hourly basis. They carry rifles that aren't loaded.CBC News has obtained a copy of an email directed to student soldiers with the Armed Forces telling them not to wear their uniforms, even on base.Another email sent to military personnel authorized the wearing of uniforms on base, as well as inside their cars while travelling between the base and their homes, but that they should avoid wearing their uniforms in all other cases. The email also instructed military personnel in uniform not to make any stops — not even at gas stations, daycares, schools and elsewhere — while travelling between their base and home.At the armoury in Hamilton, non-uniformed people were passing in and out of the gates, with uniformed guards standing watch at each side. People have been bringing flowers and notices of condolences to the building.Veteran Ed Hughes dropped off a cross to the armoury Wednesday. ""I was injured in service,"" he said. ""It broke my heart when I found out he was from Hamilton. It broke my heart he was a Sutherland.""With files from Stephanie MatteisTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

428,Did Argentina’s president ‘adopt’ a Jewish boy to save him from life as a ‘werewolf’?,"This article is more than 1 year oldLast week, Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner ""adopted"" a boy as her godson to prevent him from turning into a werewolf, according to multiple news reports. A report in the Guardian subsequently deemed the story spurious.Kirchner tweeted images of a small ceremony conducted with the family of Yair Tawil, the seventh child of an Argentine Jewish family, during which the Tawils met with the president and lit candles on a menorah. She was adopting the child as her godson, a symbolic gesture made by generations of Argentine leaders over the years.According to the Independent, tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as ""el lobison"" in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form. The legend stems from indigenous folklore and melded with superstitions of European settlers in the 19th century. The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.In the past half-century, the ceremonies have been opened up to girls and now, for the first time, Jews. The Tawil family appealed to the Argentine government as early as the 1990s to have the practice extended to non-Catholic families. The boy's new status as the president's godson wins him a gold medal as well as a full educational scholarship, according to the Independent.Tales of shape-shifting demons and feral monsters slaughtering livestock can be found in many parts of Latin America. This Argentine iteration can be traced to a local Guarani story of the seven cursed spawn of Tau, an evil mythological spirit, and Kerana, a beautiful woman he seduced and kidnapped. The seventh son was ""Luison,"" who appears sometimes in the shape of a small dog and feeds on corpses.But, citing an Argentine historian, the Guardian disputes the connection between beliefs about this folk horror and the presidential act of adopting a seventh son as a godson, and says the latter is a distinct custom brought over by Eastern European migrants. In updates posted to their Web sites, both the Independent and Buzzfeed say European folklore surrounding seventh sons included fears of the child turning into a monster.In any case, Americans should not be so quick to scoff at the tradition and its embrace by Argentina's head of state, in whatever form. After all, the U.S. president participates in the ritual pardoning of a fluffy and presumably bewildered animal every year.Update: This post has been updated to reflect new skepticism around initial media reports.The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy",94307,4265,106248,1245,341,12906,"0"

433,Nigeria and Boko Haram 'agree ceasefire and girls' release',"Nigeria's military says it has agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram - and that the schoolgirls the group has abducted will be released.Nigeria's chief of defence staff, Alex Badeh, announced the truce. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.The group has been fighting an insurgency since 2009, with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year.Boko Haram sparked global outrage six months ago by abducting more than 200 schoolgirls.The girls were seized in the north-eastern town of Chibok in Borno state, and their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government's efforts to secure their release.Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign said in a tweet on Friday: ""We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.""Air Chief Marshal Badeh revealed the truce at the close of a three-day security meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon. He said Nigerian soldiers would comply with the agreement.Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told BBC Focus on Africa that the agreement was sealed after a month of negotiations, mediated by Chad.As part of the talks, a government delegation twice met representatives of the Islamist group.Mr Tukur said Boko Haram had announced a unilateral ceasefire on Thursday and the government had responded.""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" he said. ""I am cautiously optimistic.""He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at another meeting next week in Chad's capital, Ndjamena.The negotiations are said to have the blessing of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, reports the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja.Speaking to the BBC, Nigerian government spokesman Mike Omeri said Boko Haram would not be given territory under the ceasefire agreement - and that the government would not reveal what concessions it would make.""We are inching closer to release of all groups in captivity, including the Chibok girls,"" he said.Analysis: Will Ross, BBC News, LagosNigerian officials had not given any indication that negotiations with Boko Haram were taking place. Even though there had been rumours of talks in neighbouring Chad, this is a very surprising development.If this turns out to be true it will be some of the best news Nigerians have heard for decades.   Many Nigerians are extremely sceptical about the announcement, especially as there has been no definitive word from the jihadists.Some question whether the announcement was in any way timed to coincide with the imminent announcement that President Goodluck Jonathan is going to run for re-election.  The military has in the past released statements about the conflict in north-east Nigeria that have turned out to be completely at odds with the situation on the ground.So many here will only celebrate when the violence stops and the hostages are free. In May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of emergency in the northern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, vowing to crush the Islamist insurgency. But Boko Haram increased its attacks this year. The group promotes a version of Islam which makes it ""haram"", or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society.It frequently attacks schools and colleges, which it sees as a symbol of Western culture.Who are Boko Haram?Profile: Boko Haram leader Abubakar ShekauHuman Rights Watch has reported that 2,053 civilian were killed in the first half of the year, while Amnesty International estimated that 4,000 people were killed in violence - including Nigerian military operations - in the first seven months of 2014.Boko Haram is seeking to establish an Islamist state in Nigeria, but its fighters often cross the long and porous border with Cameroon.Eight Cameroon soldiers and more than 100 Boko Haram militants were killed in fighting in the far north of Cameroon on Friday, Reuters quoted the country's defence ministry as saying.In July, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger agreed to form a 2,800-strong regional force to tackle Boko Haram militants.Afghan leader addresses nation as Taliban advanceThe comments come as the Taliban close in on the capital Kabul, with fierce fighting under way.July was Earth's hottest month ever recordedâWorld silently watches this war against womenâ VideoâWorld silently watches this war against womenâ'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car'Afghans living under Taliban lament loss of freedomsWill Biden's biggest call yet also be his most calamitous?The female Afghan journalist who won't give up.

434,Canada PM Calls Parliament Shooting a 'Terrorist' Act ,"Suspect dead, soldier killed in Ottawa shootings.Gunman Opens Fire Inside Parliament in Canada— -- A gunman fatally shot a Canadian soldier in an attack near the Parliament in what the prime minster called a ""terrorist"" act.The gunman, who was shot and killed inside the Parliament building, has been identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian national. The slain soldier was Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist from Hamilton, Ontario.Ottawa police first learned of the attacks after receiving multiple 911 calls at 9:52 a.m. about a shooting at the National War Memorial. Gunfire was later reported inside the Parliament building, less than 400 yards away. The Parliament building was put into lockdown as government officials hid in their offices while police searched the sprawling building.Prime Minister Stephen Harper made a televised statement to the nation this evening about the incident. ""Let there be no misunderstanding, we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated,"" he said, noting this was the second attack against the country this week.""In the days to come we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices,"" he added. Harper said the government would work to ""keep Canada safe and fight against terrorist organizations that are brutalizing so many people around the world in the hope of keeping their savagery from reaching our shores.""Canada had already raised its national terrorism alert level today, following an incident Monday in which a Canadian soldier was killed in a hit-and-run by a man suspected to have been a radicalized jihadist.Officials were investigating any terrorist ties to the suspect in today's shooting, but have not made any official statements. The prime minister provided no details on any such connections to the suspect.Police initially believed that they were searching for more than one shooter, but tonight the Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said his police chief told him that there were no additional shooters.""Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,"" Watson said.Civic Hospital in Ottawa received four patients, including the wounded soldier who later died of his injuries.""Apart from first patient, they had minor, non-life threatening injuries and remain in hospital at this time,"" hospital spokeswoman Hazel Harding told ABC News.One of the patients was a Parliamentary Security officer who had been shot in the leg when the gunman entered the building, but the hospital said that it was an ""extremity gunshot wound"" and is ""quite stable."" Two others were brought to the hospital with unspecified injuries. All three were later released.Witnesses told CTV they saw a man with long hair carrying a rifle at the war memorial and heard four shots fired at the soldier, who was guarding Canada's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.A witness told Canada's CBC the gunman then ran the short distance to Canada’s Parliament, jumped a wall, stopped a car at gunpoint and hijacked it. The gunman drove the car to the Centre Block on Parliament Hill where senior government leaders have their offices.A CBC reporter inside the Canadian Parliament reported chaos there, hearing multiple gunshots. A lawmaker tweeted that more than 30 shots were heard inside Parliament's Center Block.The gunman was shot dead by the Parliament’s Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers.The gunfire prompted security forces to take Prime Minister Harper to a ""safe"" place not at Parliament Hill, his spokesperson said. Harper's usual office is in a building near the shooting site.""The prime minister is safe and not on Parliament Hill and being briefed by security officials,"" his spokesman Jason MacDonald said.In the initial chaos police believed that a shooting had also occurred at a nearby mall, but that proved to be false.All military bases in Canada have been put on lock-down in response to the events in Ottawa, CTV reported. The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa followed suit.Senior FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials told ABC News they are closely monitoring the situation. The White House said President Obama was briefed.ABC News' Pierre Thomas contributed to this report.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",16799819,507,89738,1759,2161,375817,"1"
435,Paul Walker Hosted Charity Event For Philippines Typhoon Victims Before Fatal Accident,"Paul Walker was doing good and giving back on the day of his tragic death on Saturday, Nov. 30. Hours before he and an unidentified man lost their lives in a single car collision and explosion, the 40-year-old actor was co-hosting  a charity event for Philippines Typhoon victims in Santa Clarita, Calif. through his non-profit organization, Reach Out Worldwide.In 2010, ROWW was created as a disaster relief organization to help victims from the Haiti earthquake in January 2010. After taking a trip there, Walker returned and according to the site, ""contacted a group of his friends to assist him in forming ROWW with the purpose of filling this unmet need"" of skilled resources. Since then, the organization has helped victims of the Oklahoma City tornado in June, and other victims from natural disasters.After attending the toy drive Saturday, titled ""Winter Drive,"" Walker went for a drive in a red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, which belonged to a friend, TMZ reports. The Fast and the Furious actor was the passenger when his friend lost control and slammed the vehicle into a tree.The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station confirmed to Us Weekly in a statement that there were two fatalities in the traffic collision at approximately 3:30 p.m. The Los Angeles County Fire Department extinguished the fiery fire, but the victims were dead at the scene.Hours before the crash, Walker took what would be one of his last photos with an entrepreneur, Bill Townsend. Shortly after the tragic news broke, Townsend shared the picture and a message on his Facebook page.""I was just with him no more than 2 or 3 hours ago. Talking cars, he was so happy seeing all his friends get together to look at the cars,"" he wrote. ""I hope it wasn't him in the wreck, but if it was, he would have passed doing something he loved, which is driving cars. The world lost an angel in Paul. He dedicated so much of his life to helping disadvantaged kids and people who are in need, with his charity recently assisting those in the tornadoes in the Midwest and the trauma in the Philippines.""He added: ""Just today we had hundreds of toys donated for kids, all apart of Paul's charity. If this sad news indeed true I’m going to do whatever I can to keep Paul's goals for the charity alive.""In the photo, Walker had his hands in his pocket as he wore a black t-shirt, sunglasses, and donned some scruff. Walker had been gearing up the past few months to reprise his role as Brian O'Conner in Fast and the Furious 7, which is set for a 2014 release date.

444,"Marijuana May Mean Ticket, Not Arrest, in New York City","AdvertisementSupported byBy Joseph GoldsteinThe New York Police Department, which has been arresting tens of thousands of people a year for low-level marijuana possession, is poised to stop making such arrests and to issue tickets instead, according to law enforcement officials.People found with small amounts of marijuana would be issued court summonses and be allowed to continue on their way without being handcuffed and taken to station houses for fingerprinting.The change would remake the way the police in New York City handle the most common drug offenses and would represent Mayor Bill de Blasio’s most significant effort since taking office to address the enduring effects of the department’s excessive stop-and-frisk practices.Curbing arrests for small-scale marijuana possession has become a cause for criminal justice reform advocates, and this year, the new Brooklyn district attorney, Kenneth P. Thompson, said he would stop prosecuting such cases. But his announcement did not go over well with Mr. de Blasio and his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, who vowed to continue making low-level marijuana arrests.Now, the de Blasio administration is publicly embracing the notion that such small-scale possession merits different treatment. And with the changes, City Hall is moving to retake control of a politically potent issue that has enormous resonance in the black and Latino communities, where a vast majority of small-scale marijuana arrests have taken place.In the first eight months of the year, blacks and Hispanics represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city, according to a study written in part by Harry G. Levine, a sociology professor at Queens College who is a director of the Marijuana Arrest Research Project. Many details of the changes planned by the de Blasio administration are still being discussed at City Hall, and many questions remain unanswered. Under the new policy, for example, will the 25 grams or less that constitutes misdemeanor possession under state law be the threshold below which a summons is issued? Will a lit marijuana cigarette be treated differently from a packet of unsmoked cannabis? Other key questions, such as the cost of the fines or whether a criminal record would typically result from a summons, may not be up to City Hall. The procedure for the issuance of a criminal court summons for a person found with 25 grams or less of marijuana in a public place and open to public view.A clearer picture is expected to emerge this week, as Mr. de Blasio prepares for his first meeting with the city’s five district attorneys. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Marti Adams, declined to comment on the proposed policy change, although officials in two of the district attorney’s offices confirmed that the de Blasio administration was working on a new policy for how the police handle marijuana cases. In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Thompson expressed concern about the mayor’s plan, calling it an end-run around the district attorneys that could end up hurting some of the very people the changes are supposed to help.Since July, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases involving police arrests, or about 34 percent of the total 2,526 such cases in Brooklyn. Under the proposed changes, it appears that instead of being arrested, those given a ticket for marijuana will be told to appear in a courtroom. But the new policy could push prosecutors out of the process, because summonses issued without an accompanying arrest generally do not receive prosecutorial review. “In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,” Mr. Thompson said. “By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.”Another possible effect of the new policy would be that many of the tickets later convert into arrest warrants if the person misses a court date, he said. There are currently about 1.2 million active warrants in New York relating to missed court dates and unpaid fines for misdemeanors and noncriminal violations. In 2013, people failed to pay or show up to court about a quarter of the time for the 329,198 summons cases on the dockets of the city’s lowest level criminal courts, according to court statistics. Under the current practice, more than half of those arrested for marijuana were released a couple of hours after being brought to a station house, according to 2012 data gathered by the Criminal Justice Agency, a nonprofit that assists with bail determinations. They were fingerprinted, checked for warrants and issued a ticket demanding their appearance in court six to eight weeks later. The remainder of those arrested for marijuana possession were “put through the system,” meaning they were held for up to 24 hours before being arraigned before a judge.In New York, the debate over marijuana arrests has been less about drug decriminalization than it has been about the aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics that came to define the Police Department’s crime-fighting strategies. During the Bloomberg administration, the police arrested as many as 50,000 people a year on minor marijuana charges, meaning that some years, approximately one in eight arrests made by the police was for marijuana. In some cases, arrests were made after officers stopped people under dubious circumstances and instructed them to remove any contraband from their pockets. In 1977, the Legislature in New York moved to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that were not in public view. That meant that carrying a small bag of marijuana hidden in a pocket was supposed to be a ticket-eligible violation that did not amount to a crime. But since the mid-1990s, the police have routinely arrested people they found with marijuana and charged them with a misdemeanor, even though it was only supposed to apply to marijuana that was burning or discovered in “public view.” In 2011, the police commissioner at the time, Raymond W. Kelly, issued an unusual order reminding officers that the misdemeanor was not the appropriate charge in many cases.In 2013, the police still arrested more than 28,000 people for marijuana possession, and in 2014, the arrests were occurring at a similar pace, Professor Levine said. While campaigning for mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, emphatically criticized the department’s marijuana arrest practices. His populist outrage against heavy-handed policing in minority neighborhoods helped propel him into City Hall. But since becoming mayor in January, he has exerted little pressure on the department, instead often deferring to Commissioner Bratton, who has made a national reputation for aggressive street policing combined with an ability to soothe the often-inflamed relations between big-city police departments and the minority neighborhoods they serve. Yet Mr. de Blasio now finds himself under increasing pressure to deliver on his platform of police reform. That pressure began in July after a black Staten Island man died after a police officer put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Since then, the departures of the department’s top Hispanic official and its highest-ranking black officer have led a number of minority lawmakers and City Hall allies to begin to question Mr. de Blasio’s oversight of the police.

457,A world without chocolate? Confection giants sound the alarm,"Watch CBSN Live

November 17, 2014 / 9:40 AM
          / CBS News
        Are the holidays going to be a little less sweet this year?The world's cocoa supply - for decades in trouble - could soon be reaching a breaking point. Two global chocolate giants, Mars, Inc. and Barry Callebaut, are warning that global demand for one of the world's most popular commodities will outpace supply by one million metric tons by 2020, Bloomberg reports.As CBS Moneywatch reported last month, Ebola has been the most recent culprit. West Africa produces nearly three-quarters of the world's cocoa -- with Ivory Coast and Ghana responsible for 60 percent of that supply. Those nations' proximity to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone -- the epicenters of the Ebola outbreak -- have fueled worries that the virus could ultimately  stall production, and trigger another spike in world cocoa prices.Also threatening the global supply of cocoa is severe drought in Africa. The lack of rain has continued to wreak havoc on crops in Ivory Coast and Ghana. That means smaller, lower-quality cocoa beans that must be processed more to yield the same amount of chocolate.The International Cocoa Organization estimates that pests and diseases - with menacing names like Witches' Broom and Frosty Pod Rot -- have cut up to 40 percent of global cocoa production. The former fungus was responsible for wiping out cocoa production by almost 70 percent in Bahia, Brazil over a 10-year period, the group said.Demand has risen - in part fueled by growing desire for the treat in China and increasing demand for dark  chocolate. According to the Washington Post, demand officially surpassed  supply in 2012 and cocoa prices have soared more than 60 percent since  then.""If prices rise at a greater rate, chocolate manufacturers will pass the increase onto consumers,"" Andrew Rolle of Juremont, a major Australian importer of chocolate ingredients, told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""It's a fragile market there at the best of times. There will be labor issues with the cocoa farmers in the fields, political issues, transport issues with accessing stock through ports.""

Many who shared the poignant drawing online believed it was created by the enigmatic street artist. However a spokesman for Banksy told the Independent: ""We can confirm this is not by Banksy.""The drawing is actually by French illustrator Lucille Clerc, who posted the tribute on her official Twitter page after the shooting, which left 12 dead. Several fake Banksy social media accounts have attracted thousands of followers, however the artist has confirmed on his official website that he is not on Facebook or Twitter.

462,Ottawa shooting: Kevin Vickers hailed as hero who helped stop attacker,"House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers was lauded by members of Parliament Wednesday for his reported role in stopping an assailant who killed a Canadian Forces member in Ottawa.Vickers, 58, a native of Miramichi, N.B., was reportedly in the House of Commons when a gunman entered sometime after 9:52 a.m.Two sources told The Canadian Press that Vickers shot the assailant inside the Hall of Honour, the main entrance to the Centre Block beneath the Peace Tower.Officials have not confirmed that Vickers fired at the suspect, but multiple MPs credited Vickers on Twitter with helping to stop the attacker.On Twitter, MPs credited Vickers with saving their lives:Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security that included protecting foreign dignitaries and members of the Royal Family. He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick. Before his appointment as sergeant-of-arms, Vickers was director of security operations for the House of Commons.The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament Buildings.Vickers's brother John, who lives in Victoria, told CBC News Wednesday that his brother called their mother, Monica, at her New Brunswick home shortly after the incident to tell her he is safe. ""I just couldn't be prouder of him right now,"" John said, adding that his brother has ""always been committed to service, people and country."" When asked about Vickers’s reported heroics, his cousin Keith said “It’s Kevin being Kevin.”“He’s a very intelligent and responsible person. He’s a people person-type fellow, too, but you don’t want to mess with him,” said Keith. “All the boys, the local guys, they’ll be quite proud to hear he did what he did.”According to Keith, Vickers’s son is currently a police officer with the local force in Miramichi.Dan Bussières, the current sergeant-at-arms in the New Brunswick Legislature and Vickers’s colleague in the RCMP for many years, called him “a true gentleman who is very responsible.”“He’s the perfect man to be the sergeant-at-arms in Ottawa right now. I can assure you of that,” Bussières said. Prior to his appointment in the House of Commons, Vickers worked as an aide-de-camp for New Brunswick's former lieutenant-governor, Marilyn Trenholme Counsell.Vickers served under Trenholme Counsell for four years starting in 1999. She watched closely Wednesday as reports came in about the shootings in Ottawa and news that Vickers may have played a central role in the events.Trenholme Counsell said she was not surprised to learn of his possible involvement.""Not at all, it's so much in his character to take charge of something and do what has to be done,"" she said from her home as TV news reports played in the background.""He is fearless in the face of a challenge. It didn't surprise me that he acted.""As an RCMP officer, Vickers was responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.He is a recipient of the Queen's Jubilee medal, the Canada 125 medal and the RCMP Long Service medal. Former RCMP deputy commissioner Pierre-Yves Bourduas, who has also served as a security chief on Parliament Hill, called Vickers a ""natural planner"" and said his former RCMP colleague has always ""had a contingency plan.""""He actually did mock-up scenarios for the personnel ... very much like what happened today,"" Bourdas said. ""Knowing Kevin the way I do, he is very troubled by this chain of events.""Although sergeants-at-arms often operate outside of the public spotlight, the events on Parliament Hill are not the first time they have been instrumental in preventing bloodshed in Canadian history.When army supply clerk Denis Lortie opened fire in Quebec's National Assembly in 1984, the legislature's sergeant-at-arms went into the chamber and tried to calm him.Rene Jalbert, a retired major in the army, offered Lortie a cigarette and eventually persuaded him to release about a dozen hostages who were cowering in the chamber.The legislature was minutes away from convening when Lortie entered the building through a side door carrying two submachine guns, and at one point sat in the Speaker's chair firing wildly. He killed three people and wounded 13 others.On mobile?

                IRS Sent $46,378,040 in Refunds to 23,994 ‘Unauthorized’ Aliens at 1 Atlanta Address
              ","(CNSNews.com) - The Internal Revenue Service sent 23,994 tax refunds worth a combined $46,378,040 to “unauthorized” alien workers who all used the same address in Atlanta, Ga., in 2011, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).That was not the only Atlanta address theoretically used by thousands of “unauthorized” alien workers receiving millions in federal tax refunds in 2011. In fact, according to a TIGTA audit report published last year, four of the top ten addresses to which the IRS sent thousands of tax refunds to “unauthorized” aliens were in Atlanta.The IRS sent 11,284 refunds worth a combined $2,164,976 to unauthorized alien workers at a second Atlanta address; 3,608 worth $2,691,448 to a third; and 2,386 worth $1,232,943 to a fourth.Other locations on the IG’s Top Ten list for singular addresses that were theoretically used simultaneously by thousands of unauthorized alien workers, included an address in Oxnard, Calif, where the IRS sent 2,507 refunds worth $10,395,874; an address in Raleigh, North Carolina, where the IRS sent 2,408 refunds worth $7,284,212; an address in Phoenix, Ariz., where the IRS sent 2,047 refunds worth $5,558,608; an address in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., where the IRS sent 1,972 refunds worth $2,256,302; an address in San Jose, Calif., where the IRS sent 1,942 refunds worth $5,091,027; and an address in Arvin, Calif., where the IRS sent 1,846 refunds worth $3,298,877.Since 1996, the IRS has issued what it calls Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) to two classes of persons: 1) non-resident aliens who have a tax liability in the United States, and 2) aliens living in the United States who are “not authorized to work in the United States.”The IRS has long known it was giving these numbers to illegal aliens, and thus facilitating their ability to work illegally in the United States. For example, the Treasury Inspector General’s Semiannual Report to Congress published on Oct. 29, 1999—nearly fourteen years ago—specifically drew attention to this problem.“The IRS issues Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) to undocumented aliens to improve nonresident alien compliance with tax laws. This IRS practice seems counter-productive to the Immigration and Naturalization Service’s (INS) mission to identify undocumented aliens and prevent unlawful alien entry,” TIGTA warned in that long-ago report.The inspector general’s 2012 audit report on the IRS’s handling of ITINs was spurred by two IRS employees who went to members of Congress ""alleging that IRS management was requiring employees to assign Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN) even when the applications were fraudulent.”In an August 2012 press release accompanying the audit report, TIGTA said the report “validated” the complaints of the IRS employees.“TIGTA’s audit found that IRS management has not established adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the assignment of an ITIN to individuals submitting questionable applications,” said Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George. “Even more troubling, TIGTA found an environment which discourages employees from detecting fraudulent applications.”In addition to the 23,994 tax refunds worth a combined $46,378,040 that the IRS sent to a single address in Atlanta, the IG also discovered that the IRS had assigned 15,796 ITINs to unauthorized aliens who presumably used a single Atlanta address.The IRS, according to TIGTA, also assigned ITINs to 15,028 unauthorized aliens presumably using a single address in Dallas, Texas, and 10,356 to unauthorized aliens presumably living at a single address in Atlantic City, N.J.Perhaps the most remarkable act of the IRS was this: It assigned 6,411 ITINs to unauthorized aliens presumably using a single address in Morganton, North Carolina. According to the 2010 Census, there were only 16,681 people in Morganton. So, for the IRS to have been correct in issuing 6,411 ITINS to unauthorized aliens at a single address in Morganton it would have meant that 38 percent of the town’s total population were unauthorized alien workers using a single address.TIGTA said there were 154 addresses around the country that appeared on 1,000 or more ITIN applications made to the IRS.Copyright 1998-2021 CNSNews.com.CNSNews.com is a division of the Media Research Center.The mission of the Media Research Center is to

When they contacted that individual, he reported that he had sold the dog in 2013 but did not have any information on the new owner.Taylor said that the group will care for the dog until they find an owner for Kai.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",16799821,507,49729,1376,330,29867,"1"

493,Kevin Vickers pictured in Parliament moments after killing Michael Zehaf-Bibeau,"By Josh Gardner for MailOnline  Published:  02:02 EDT, 23 October 2014   |  Updated:  13:48 EDT, 23 October 2014    875View  commentsJust moments after he gunned down Canadian Parliament shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, heroic sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers was seen calmly walking through the halls, gun in hand.The 58-year-old RCMP veteran has been hailed a hero after putting a swift stop to the attacker's hail of gunfire after he shot dead a soldier and then stormed the building on Wednesday morning.A CBC News still shows Vickers holding the gun and walking through the House of Commons' moments after taking down the assailant. Vickers has been the House of Commons' head of security since 2005 and will now go down in history as one of its most memorable after he bravely pursued and took down Zehaf-Bibeau.Scroll down for videosJob done: Kevin Vickers, Canada's House of Commons' sergeant-at-arms, looks around the hallways with a gun in his hand after shooting dead an attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, on Wednesday morningIn control: Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before taking on the role, is being hailed a heroDespite working for the RCMP for three decades, relatives said the incident was the first time in his career that Vickers had ever shot anyone. Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons on Wednesday makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused. A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens.At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier.The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots.As those shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover. Back to work: Heroic Kevin Vickers was pictured at work on Thursday just hours after he shot dead Zehaf-Bibeau and stopped the terrorist in his tracksCanadian hero: Vickers, 58, is pictured in a file photo wearing his ceremonial garb and carrying a scepter. As sergeant-at-arms, it his job to uphold the security of the House of CommonsRiveting video: Vickers led the way as officials chased down terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau on Wednesday after he murdered reservist Nathan Cirillo and entered the House of Commons buildingInches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus roomsAnd like that, it was over. Vickers had brought to a close the terrifying scene of senseless violence in mere moments of professional poise.'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott.Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred. 'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.Vickers has honed his peacekeeping skills over a prestigious 28-year career as a member Royal Canadian Mounted Police.And peacekeeping is the word. According to his brother, Wednesday's showdown was Vickers' first exchange of gunfire with a suspect in his nearly three-decade long career.'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'  Heroic: He took down Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, pictured - his first ever exchange of gunfire in his careerInnocent victim: Natan Cirillo, 24, was the soldier shot dead in Wednesday's terror attack on the Canadian Parliament complex'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.' On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke. Vickers - already back in work - was greeted by a standing ovation from parliament. Humbly nodding his head, the police veteran received handshakes from leading politicians. Vickers received a standing ovation from MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday when he returned to the more usual duty of delivering the ceremonial mace to the chamberVickers remained mostly expressionless during the ovation before briefly appearing close to tears, and eventually acknowledging the applause with several nods of thanksHe released a statement paying tribute to Nathan Cirillo and revealed another police officer was shot in the leg. 'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'Earlier in the morning, a man was arrested for getting too close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen as they placed flowers at the scene of the shooting. Armed officers ordered the unidentified man to the ground for 'disturbing the crime scene' after he was warned not to cross the crime tape but did.  On Wednesday evening Harper addressed his nation from an undisclosed location and condemned the horrific actions but vowed his country's foreign policy would not be thrown off course.   'Canada will never be intimidated,' he said. Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events.'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said. Immigration chief Susan Bibeau - mother of terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. 'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.' Tribute: Stephen Harper laid a floral tribute at the scene of the shooting alongside his wife Loreen on Thursday morningArrest: An unidentified man was arrested for disturbing the crime scene as security concerns are still high across OttawaChilling footage appears to have caught the moment that gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau got into a hijacked car moments after shooting a soldier dead at Ottawa's War Memorial.Footage from a dashcam appears to show the Muslim convert climb into the driver's side of a Toyota Corolla that - according to witnesses - he had stolen earlier.Zehaf-Bibeau stormed the Parliament minutes later having abandoned the car in the street with the engine running after he had driven a short distance from the cenotaph.A shoot-out with armed officials ensued, with Zehaf-Bibeau eventually shot dead by Vickers as shocked politicians and journalists barricaded themselves in rooms and cowered in corridors.One eye witness said that as many as 30 shots were fired in the exchange, which took place just yards away from where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking. The 32-year-old had callously shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, in the stomach at point-blank range while he was on ceremonial duty.Despite the desperate efforts of medics, Mr Cirillo succumbed to his injuries in hospital.A witness told The Ottawa Citizen that he'd seen a man armed with a double-barrelled shotgun wearing a scarf 'hijack a car'.He added: 'It was pretty intense.' Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group",2635269,2239,27772,1761,1545,25779,"1"

512,This Puppy-Sized Spider Will Haunt Your Dreams,"Scientist shocked by ginormous arachnid on nighttime rain forest walk.Giant Rainforest Spider Rivals Puppies for Size— -- If you didn’t have arachnophobia before now, this puppy-sized spider should do the trick.Known as South American Goliath birdeater, the humongous eight-legged creepy crawly creature has a body the size of a fist and a leg span the size of a small child. Harvard entomologist Piotr Naskrecki recently encountered one while taking a nighttime stroll through a rain forest in Guyana.""When I turned on the light, I couldn't quite understand what I was seeing,"" Naskrecki told the website Live Science.The spider can weigh up to six ounces, according to Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology, where Naskrecki is employed. Though it does not eat birds, as the name implies, it hunts worms, rats and other small animals.Size isn’t the spider’s only chill-inducing quality. It makes loud clicking sounds with its front claws when threatened and defends itself by rubbing its back legs together to shoot clouds of microscopic barbs through the air that are highly irritating to the eyes and skin. If it chomps down on you with its 2-inch-long fangs, you probably won’t die,  unless you are allergic. But its bite contains enough venom to make you sick for days.Naskrecki said birdeaters are uncommon. He has only encountered three in all the years he has been traipsing through rain forests. He also did not specify whether his latest meeting ended in a capture for study.But it’s a safe bet he couldn’t kill it with a shoe or trap it under a glass.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",16799821,507,59649,1241,609,145435,"1"

520,Ottawa shootings: Bruce MacKinnon's cartoon is the perfect tribute to soldier Nathan Cirillo,"Your account has been createdThe shooting brought Canada's capital to a standstillFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileTwitter users have hailed a Canadian cartoonist who created the perfect tribute to Nathan Cirillo, the soldier shot dead while guarding Ottawa's National War Memorial on Wednesday morning.The very moving image was produced for Thursday's edition of Halifax's The Chronicle Herald by cartoonist Bruce MacKinnon, and can be viewed online at their website here.The cartoon shows the bronze figures of the memorial, representing those who fought and died in the First World War, stooping down to pick up the body of the corporal and welcome him into their number.It was among the many tributes that have poured in for 24-year-old Corporal Cirillo, who was a part-time reservist serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada regiment.Police have confirmed that the incident involved a single gunman, who killed Corporal Cirillo at the base of the memorial before driving to Parliament's Central Block, where he was killed in an exchange of fire with police and security staff. The shooting suspect has been identified as 32-year-old Michael Zehaf-Bibeau from Quebec.Twitter/Kamakazi19982Megan Underwood, via FacebookAFPAPAPAPAPAPAPGetty ImagesPAReutersAPEPAEPAReutersEric TwittyGerry ByrneMike KujawskiReacting to the image on Twitter, users called it ""touching"" and thanked MacKinnon for ""capturing the spirit of a nation"".Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

561,"Alaska reporter: 'F*** it, I quit'","Do Not Sell While doing a news segment on the Alaska Cannabis Club, a medical marijuana organization in Alaska, reporter Charlo Greene made a grand exit from her position at CBS affiliate KTVA in Alaska (caution: the video is NSFW).  Greene revealed that she actually owns the marijuana club she was reporting on, and then quit her TV gig with some choice words live on air.  ""Now everything you've heard is why I, the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, will be dedicating all of my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska,"" Greene said on air. ""And as for this job, well, not that I have a choice but, f*** it, I quit.""  Related: Why it's risky to invest in pot stocks  The fact that Greene was so closely tied to an issue she was reporting on is a conflict of interest that would have forced her to step down, even if she hadn't made a vulgar statement.  The ex-reporter told the Alaska Dispatch News that her dramatic exit was her attempt to bring attention to the issue of marijuana legalization, and apologized for offending anyone.  Not long after the on-air incident, Greene created an Indiegogo campaign to raise funding ahead of the state's November 4 vote on legalizing recreational marijuana.  ""As a member of the media, I've seen the dirty campaign tricks and lies that prohibitionists have been using over the past several months to sway Alaskan voters firsthand,"" she wrote in a statement on the funding site.  Greene also posted a YouTube video explaining her position.  Meanwhile, after Charlo's on-air outburst, KTVA apologized profusely, on air and off.  ""We sincerely apologize for the inappropriate language used by a KTVA reporter during her live presentation on the air tonight,"" KTVA-11's news director Bert Rudman wrote on the station's Facebook page. ""The employee has been terminated.""  Related: Colorado's missing marijuana taxes  Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Greene's name.

His friend and business advisor, Roger Rodas, also died at the scene.The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station confirms in a statement to Us Weekly that there were two fatalities in a traffic collision at approximately 3:30 p.m. Saturday, and speed was a factor.

The Coroner's Office is currently determining the identities of the victims, and the collision is still under investigation. A source also confirms to Us that Walker was the passenger at the time, and was not the one driving.""It is with a truly heavy heart that we must confirm that Paul Walker passed away today in a tragic car accident while attending a charity event for his organization Reach Out Worldwide,"" a statement on his official Facebook page reads. ""He was a passenger in a friend's car, in which both lost their lives. We appreciate your patience as we too are stunned and saddened beyond belief by this news. Thank you for keeping his family and friends in your prayers during this very difficult time. We will do our best to keep you apprised on where to send condolences. – #TeamPW.""A native of Glendale, Calif., Walker first broke out in Hollywood in the late 90s films Pleasantville and Varsity Blues.

567,UAE's female pilot Mariam Al Mansouri 'disowned by her family',"By Ted Thornhill for MailOnline and Chris Spargo for MailOnline   Published:  08:02 EDT, 27 September 2014   |  Updated:  05:46 EDT, 28 September 2014    284View  commentsThe female air force pilot whose missions against Isis were dubbed 'boobs on the ground' has reportedly been disowned by her family and labelled an 'ingrate'.Mariam Al Mansouri's participation in F-16 bombing raids for the UAE was celebrated in the West, but an anonymous statement claiming to be from her family 'disowned' her for 'taking part in the brutal international aggression' against Syria.It also expressed support for the Islamic State, saying 'we are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant'. The brutal terrorist group's original name was the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or Isil.Scroll down for video  Courageous: Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She's pictured here in an F-16 Desert Eagle Major Al Mansouri's F-16 fighter was one of several from a group of Arab nations that are blitzing IsisIn the name of God All Merciful.'O ye who believe! Take not your fathers or your brethren for friends if they favour disbelief over faith. Those of you who taketh them for friends are wrong-doers.' [Quranic verse]'Renouncement of Mariam Al Mansouri:'We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people, starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri. 'We hereby remind the Muslim nation all over the world of its duty to defend the causes of the nation [meaning the Islamic nation], and we urge them to take up the jihad [holy war] for the sake of God to support the blessed Syrian revolution against the descendants of Ibn Al Alqami.' [Sunni Islamist insurgents refer to the Shi'a as 'alqami' - a reference to Mu'ayyad al-Din Muhammad Ibn al-Alqami, a Shi'ite minister in the last Abbasid caliphate, who purportedly assisted the Mongols in conquering Baghdad in 1258.]'We call upon all factions and battalions operating on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime perched on the pure and blessed Syrian land.'Al Mansouri family, in the UAE and abroad, takes this opportunity to declare its support for the blessed Syrian revolution and to all free men defending their rights everywhere in the world.'Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation [The Islamic Nation}. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be. We may not know them, but God knows them and would champion them.'We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri. All the honourable members of our family have agreed to this statement.'Al Mansouri family.' The statement also expressed support for the Syrian revolution, according to the Palestinian Wattan news agency.It said: 'We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people, starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri. 'We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri.'It continued: 'We call upon all factions... on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime.'Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation [the Islamic Nation]. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be.'It's not clear whether the views expressed in the statement represent those of the entire family or indeed if it is genuine.The Mansouri tribe has some influential members, including the country's economics minister, but it's also very large – the second biggest in Abu Dhabi, the capital of UAE, so it certainly can't be assumed that the views expressed in the statement are representative of the whole group.The statement could well have been made anonymously out of fear of punishment, as voicing dissent against the UAE government can result in imprisonment.If true, the statement won't represent the first time the Mansouri family has been linked to extremism. In January this year high-profile lawyer Mohammed al-Mansoori was jailed for allegedly trying to set up an 'international' branch of the controversial Muslim Brotherhood in the UAE, according to the BBC.Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She joined it in 2007 and is now a squadron commander.She is one of eight children and has a degree in English literature.The UAE is known to have the most liberal views on women's rights in the Middle East and Mansouri said that she was treated as an equal by her commanding officers.She told Deraa Al Watan magazine: 'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence.'She says that her nearest relatives are supportive of her role in the air force.There was also no difference between men and women with regards to training and assignments, she said.'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence,'Earlier this week Fox News host Eric Bolling apologised for calling Major Mansouri's missions as 'boobs on the ground'.  Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air forcA Fox News host has issued an apology after making a sexist comment about a female fighter pilot earlier this week on The Five.During a segment about Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri, a female pilot from the United Arab Emirates who led a mission this week against ISIS in Syria, Eric Bolling referred to her mission as 'boobs on the ground.'Now, after outrage from viewers, and even his own wife, following these insensitive remarks, he has apologized.'I made a joke and when I got home, I got the look, and realized some people didn't think it was funny at all,' Bolling said on the air today. 'I said sorry to my wife and I apologize to all of you as well and want to make that very clear.'This all began when Bolling's cohost, Kimberly Guilfoyle, praised Maj. Mansouri on the program Wednesday afternoon.'Hey ISIS, you were bombed by a woman,' Guilfoyle said. 'Oh yeah, hell came down on ISIS in Syria, because guess what: the first female pilot piloting for the [United Arab Emirates], there she was, leading the strikes. Dropped the bombs on ISIS Monday night.'Maj. Mansouri, 35, was the first woman to join the Emirati Air Force.'This is really incredible,' Guilfoyle continued.'Major Mariam Al Mansouri is who did this. Remarkable, very excited. I wish it was an American pilot. I'll take a woman doing this any day to them. Right after she said this, the men on the panel began making sexist jokes. It comes as Britain, Belgium and Denmark on Friday joined the U.S.-led coalition of nations that are launching airstrikes on Isis. The European politicians flatly described the moves as critical to security on home soil, arguing that facing down terrorists has become a matter of urgency. Prime Minister David Cameron made a passionate plea for action in drastic terms - noting that the militants had beheaded their victims, gouged out eyes and carried out crucifixions to promote goals 'from the Dark Ages.' 'This is about psychopathic terrorists that are trying to kill us and we do have to realize that, whether we like it or not, they have already declared war on us,' he said. 'There isn't a `walk on by' option. There isn't an option of just hoping this will go away.' Cameron told a tense House of Commons during more than six hours of debate that the hallmarks of the campaign would be 'patience and persistence, not shock and awe' - a reference to the phrase associated with the invasion of Iraq. That unpopular intervention has cast a shadow over the discussions because critics fear that Europe will be drawn into a wider conflict, specifically taking on the Islamic group's fighters in Syria. British MPs voted 524-43 for action after being urgently recalled from a recess. Belgian lawmakers also overwhelmingly approved, voting 114-2 to take part, despite widespread concerns that more terrorism may follow in their homeland as a result. The White House said in a statement that it welcomed the countries to the coalition. 'These decisions - along with those by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar to participate in airstrikes against ISIL in Syria - demonstrate the clear commitment of the international community to take action together against these terrorists,' the statement reads. Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group",18202,18995,7154,4406,1272,16559,"0"

575,The Motoring World Responds To Paul Walker's Death,"After news first broke of Paul Walker's death last night, there was an outpouring of condolences from across the world. Unusual for an actor, though, was the outpouring from the racing world. Racers from all walks stepped forth on Twitter to offer their thoughts.Fast And Furious star Paul Walker died earlier this evening after a car accident in Santa Clarita,…The Porsche Carrera GT he was a passenger in was driven by Roger Rodas, his financial advisor and a racer in his own right. Rodas was also killed in the crash. He and Walker first met at the track when Walker noticed that Rodas was driving a Porsche 911 GT3 he had once owned himself. For his part, Rodas was already quite successful at racing, as noted by Autoweek:Rodas, though, moved up through the ranks from Porsche-only series like the Pirelli Driver's Cup, where he won twice in 2012, into the Pirelli World Challenge, leading a two-car Ford Mustang Boss 302S team, sponsored by Always Evolving and charities that he and Walker supported. Rodas raced car number 52; his co-driver, in car 75, was Erik Davis, owner of Autotopia, a massive, near-legendary car collection in Los Angeles that supplies cars for movie and TV productions.Both rookies in the series, Rodas finished 13 in GTS points, Davis 16th, despite missing the races in St. Petersburg and Lime Rock. Has Rodas competed in those races, he almost certainly would have been the series rookie of the year. Rodas' highest finish was fifth at Toronto, impressive since the GTS class has such veteran drivers as season champ Lawson Ashenbach, Jack Baldwin and Peter Cunningham.Part of the reason Walker's death means so much to us here at Jalopnik is that he wasn't just some actor who had appeared in a few of the most important car movies of this generation, but he was a genuine enthusiast and racer himself. That's also evidenced by the shocked outcry and and sadness from the motoring world:Photo via GettyPaul Walker, Vin Diesel, and those crappy Fast and Furious movies are why I care about cars today.I wish I was exaggerating. If not for those cheese-ball movies (even the 6th, and I still love it) I can honestly say I wouldn't have taken as keen a interest in cars as a kid. Yes people die every day, people we will never know, and this is a sad reminder of how fragile life really is. It can happen to anyone and it never gives warning. Paul did a lot of good for the motoring community at large and as a person, he also made some not too shabby movies every now and then that you could just enjoy for the sake of enjoying. I'd also like to thank most of your for keeping things decently classy in the comments. There will be a time when we start LOL'ing at the memes that Reddit is already churning out and there will be a time when ""too soon junior"" isn't too soon, but for now I think we can celebrate a man who just lived a good life and honestly improved the lives of others.

584,Pope Francis Says There’s a Place for Pets in Paradise,"Pope Francis confirmed during his weekly address in the Vatican’s St. Peter’s Square that canines, along with “all of God’s creatures,” can make it to heaven.The leader of the Catholic Church made the remark in order to comfort a young boy who was mourning the death of his dog, according to the New York Times.“One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,” said the 77-year-old Pontiff, according to Italian news sources.Pope Francis has been cast as a much more liberal figure compared with his predecessors. Since ascending to the church’s helm last year, he has attempted to engage with homosexuals and unwed couples and backed the Big Bang Theory.[NYT]Correction: The original version of this story misattributed a quotation from Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, to Pope Francis. It was Pope Paul VI who said, “One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ.” The original version of this story misinterpreted comments made by Francis who said in recent remarks, according to Vatican Radio,  “The Holy Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us.” This quotation was interpreted in press accounts to mean that the Pope believes all animals go to heaven. A Vatican spokesman told Reuters on Dec. 13 that this was not the Pope’s intended message.Read next: The Pope Just Received a Fly Pair of Custom Diesel SweatpantsContact us at letters@time.com.",18247003,509,129919,1272,173,6039,"0"

609,The Cause That Paul Walker Remained Dedicated to Until the Moment of His Death,"<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreportfolio/3369495546"">andre almeida</a>/Flickr
Paul Walker, best known for starring in the popular Fast and Furious franchise, died Saturday in a car accident in Valencia, California. He was 40.It would be difficult to make the case that Walker was a particularly influential or exceptional actor. But he was a fine action star and was decent in his heavier dramatic fare. But beyond his on-screen credentials, all available evidence suggests that Walker was, up until the moment he died, a celebrity who genuinely cared about the world around him—someone who used his celebrity for worthy causes.According to a statement posted to the actor’s Facebook fan page, Walker died “in a tragic car accident while attending a charity event for his organization Reach Out Worldwide.”Reach Out Worldwide, formed by Walker in 2010, is a 501(c)(3) that provides rescue and recovery aid in the wake of major natural disasters. The group supplements rescue efforts with its own team of paramedics, doctors, and search-and-rescue professionals. Reach Out Worldwide has lent its services to disaster-relief efforts in the Philippines, Alabama, Indonesia, Chile, and Haiti. “I’d made a few runs into Port-au-Prince and was negotiating with the army to give me baby formula, tents, extension cords,” Walker told the Daily Telegraph, an Australian tabloid newspaper, in 2011. “I was hustling for everything.”Here’s his explanation for why he started Reach Out Worldwide:Because of my travels with work and pleasure, a lot of the times disasters would strike in areas that I’d been. You think of the faces—they might not be people you’re in contact with but you can’t help but wonder how that family was you had dinner with. That stuff starts crossing your mind and you feel so helpless. I would be consumed with anger, like, “Fuck! I wanna be there, I wanna do whatever I can.” One of my best friends had heard it too many times and ultimately he just held me accountable. He punked me out: “So you gonna pack your bags and go to Haiti and help out or what?”“When the shit hits the fan,” Walker continued, “that’s when you actually see the best in people.”Hours, one of the last films Walker starred in, is scheduled for a mid-December release. It’s a fitting send-off for Walker: The film is set in a hospital in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, with Walker playing a father desperately trying to protect his newborn daughter.Here’s a clip of Walker and the Fast & Furious 7 cast encouraging fans to help victims of Typhoon Haiyan: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.By signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.Mother Jones was founded as a nonprofit in 1976 because we knew corporations and the wealthy wouldn't fund the type of hard-hitting journalism we set out to do.Today, reader support makes up about two-thirds of our budget, allows us to dig deep on stories that matter, and lets us keep our reporting free for everyone.

610,Paul Walker Dead at 40: Actor’s Trailer For New Film Hours: Video,"Fast and Furious 7 wasn’t the only film Paul Walker had in the works before his death. The 40-year-old actor, who died in a tragic car wreck on Saturday, Nov. 30, gave one of his last film performances in the movie Hours. The thriller is now in post-production, and set to be released in theaters on Dec. 13. In the Eric Heisserer-directed film, Walker played the role of Nolan, a father trying to keep his infant daughter alive in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The film also stars Genesis Rodriguez, as his wife Abigail.The film’s backdrop isn’t a stretch from what the Hollywood hunk has witnessed in real life. In 2010, Walker created the non-profit organization, Reach Out Worldwide, after experiencing firsthand another natural disaster — the Haiti earthquake in January 2010.“Actor/Producer Paul Walker saw a gap between the availability of skilled resources and the requirement for such personnel in post-disaster situations,” reads a statement on his ROWW website. “Following the trip [to Haiti] he contacted a group of his friends to assist him in forming ROWW with the purpose of filling this unmet need.”Indeed, Walker — in between red carpets and promoting his own projects — always found time to give back to others. Some of his other relief efforts over the years have included helping victims from the 2010 Chile earthquake and the Oklahoma City tornado in June. On the day he died, Walker was attending a toy drive in Santa Clarita, Calif., to raise money for those who recently suffered from the Philippines Typhoon.Watch the trailer for his film Hours above.

              'Madden NFL' successfully predicts Super Bowl score
            ","NFL.com WriterEA SportsBy my unofficial count, more than 1,592 hours of Network programming broke down Super Bowl XLIX last week. Turns out, all we needed to do was to run the Madden simulator to figure out who was going to win the game. Seriously.You don't believe me? Watch this video right here. ""Madden NFL 15"" Super Bowl simulation accurately predicted the following:Â» The Seahawks were going to own the third quarter and lead the Patriots 24-14.Â» The Patriots would win the game 28-24. (Spoiler alert if you have the game on the DVR, but the Patriots would win that game by that exact score.EXACT!)Â» Tom Brady would be the Super Bowl MVP. What might be more impressive is Madden had him finishing with 335 yards and four touchdowns. He actually finished with 328 passing yards and four touchdowns. Just seven yards off. SEVEN! More impressive than the score.Â» Julian Edelman would catch the winning touchdown pass. And not only that, but the exact (EXACT) pass play to make it happen. Edelman had eight receptions for 106 yards. He finished with nine catches for 109 yards. (Mind officially blown.)Â» Pete Carroll would call an ill-advised pass play after getting the ball down to the 1-yard line with under a minute left to go in the game.All right, that last one might not have actually occurred. But would it have surprised you at this point? This was a pretty amazing run. And to think we've been so concerned about Skynet all of these years when we really should have been on the lookout for Madden, who is now 9-3 in Super Bowl simulations. Now if we could just get Madden to pick my fantasy team, too, I think we'd be all set.*You can follow Adam Rank on Twitter @adamrank. Gamertag: KickedBoar591 *Week 1 of the preseason carried on Friday with the Bills playing the Lions, the Titans facing the Falcons and the Cowboys and Cardinals locking up in the evening. Here's what we learned.Â A Super Bowl champion with the New England Patriots, RB Dion Lewis is retiring, his agent announced on Friday.Â When asked if he sees any chance safety Jamal Adams won't suit up for Seattle's regular-season opener against Indianapolis, Pete Carroll was dismissive when replying, ""I'm not even thinking about that at all.""Â Which teams boast the top pass-rushing tandems in the NFL?

621,Some iPhone 6 Plus Owners Accidentally Bending Their iPhones in Pockets,"As highlighted in a few reports shared in the MacRumors forums, a small but growing number of iPhone 6 Plus owners have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets just days after launch. In one instance, a new iPhone 6 Plus was bent during a day of dancing, dining, and driving to a wedding. Photo by hanzohYesterday, I left at 10am with the iPhone in my left FRONT pocket of my suit pants. I drove 4 hours to a wedding, which also involved a lot of sitting during dinner etc but also 2-3 hours of dancing. I left at 2am and went to bed, driving home 4 hours back.So in total, the 6 Plus was about 18 hours in my pocket while sitting mostly.As I lay it on the coffee table and sat down on the couch to relax from the drive (yes, sitting again ), I saw the reflection of the window in the iPhones slightly distorted. This potential for bending is of course not unique to the iPhone 6 Plus, with reports of bent iPhone 5 and 5s handsets surfacing in the past few years. As iPhones get thinner and larger, however, storage of the handset in a pocket becomes riskier. Unlike smaller phones that can slide out of the way, pressure points from sitting or bending now have greater potential to cause the longer iPhone to flex in a way that will damage the device. Photo by DevinPitcherTo prevent bending, iPhone 6 Plus owners may want to remove their iPhones from their pockets before sitting or bending. If a pocket is unavoidable, then customers may want to place their device in a roomier pocket that allows the device to slide out the way. A rigid case may also provide protection from flexing or bending, as well damage from dropping the device. iOS 15 is available as a public beta.

623,Super Bowl 2015: 'Madden NFL 15' Made Eerily Accurate Super Bowl Predictions,"Mind. Blown. Madden Predicts Super Bowl— -- If you missed the big game and just trusted the video game simulators at Madden NFL 15 to predict what would happen in Super Bowl XLIX, you would have been in good hands.The experts at Madden not only predicted the exact final score of the game but also a handful of other details that kept their days-old predictions eerily close to the actual results from Sunday night.Some were not entirely surprising, like the prediction that Seattle Seahawks star Marshawn Lynch would score a touchdown (which he did).Same for the Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski (he also who scored a touchdown).Madden predicted that the score would be close going into halftime - 17 to 14. The game was actually tied at the half at 14.They predicted that punt returner and wide receiver Julian Edelman would score one of the Patriot's critical touchdowns. Prior to this season, Edelman had only scored ten other touchdowns since he was first drafted in 2009.The pick that Tom Brady would earn his third MVP honor was also on target.Madden guessed that Brady would throw 335 yards, leading to four touchdowns; he was actually just shy of that, with 328 yards and four touchdowns.This is the ninth time in the past 12 years that the game has accurately predicted the winner of the Super Bowl, but this is by far the most detailed read of the virtual tea leaves.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",16799827,507,129312,1113,208,4830,"1"

651,"Canadian PM: Ottawa war memorial, Parliament shootings were terrorism","Watch CBSN Live

Updated on:  October 22, 2014 / 11:20 PM
          / CBS/AP
        OTTAWA, Ontario - Tragedy and terror struck Canada's capital city Wednesday as a gunman shot a soldier standing guard at the country's National War Memorial before storming the Parliament building, putting Ottawa's downtown on lockdown and sending terrified government members and employees scrambling for safety.Canada's prime minister called the incident the country's second terrorist attack in three days.""This week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere,"" Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a national address Wednesday evening.""We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated,"" Harper added.Law enforcement and U.S. government sources told CBS News the suspect's birth name was Michael Joseph Hall, born in Quebec in 1982. He recently converted to Islam and called himself Michael Abdul Zehaf-Bibeau. Sources said he had a history of drug addiction prior to his conversion.Zehaf-Bibeau was reportedly shot to death by the ceremonial sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons, a former police officer. The gunman's motives have not been determined.	""In the days to come we will learn about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had,"" Harper said.Canada was already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run assault Monday against two Canadian soldiers by a man Harper described as an ""ISIL-inspired terrorist,"" referring to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS.The series of incidents in Ottawa began shortly before 10 a.m., when the soldier was shot. The victim, identified to CBS News by a cousin as 24-year-old Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, was later pronounced dead from his wounds.Witnesses said Cirillo was gunned down by a man dressed all in black with a scarf over his face.""I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,"" Tony Zobl, 35, told the Canadian Press news agency.Zobl said he witnessed the incident from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial, a 70-foot, arched granite cenotaph, or tomb, with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I.""The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle,"" Zobl said.Zobl and other witnesses said the gunman then ran up the street toward Parliament Hill, and later entered the main building there, where dozens of shots rang out.A reporter for the Globe and Mail captured much of that shooting incident in a video (which can be viewed at left.) Law enforcement officials can be seen cautiously proceeding with guns drawn down a main hallway, before a single loud shot rings out. A few seconds later, a hail of gunfire erupts.People fled Parliament by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside as police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and blocked the normally bustling streets around the building.Police gave no details on how the gunman died. But on Twitter, Member of Parliament Craig Scott credited Parliament sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers with shooting the attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.Ottawa Hospital said in addition to Cirillo it received three patients, all with what were described as ""minor, non-life threatening injuries.""""Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,"" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said. He said it was a tragedy with ""origins as yet not fully known, causes not yet fully understood.""	In Washington, President Obama condemned the shootings as ""outrageous acts,"" and in a telephone call with the prime minister, offered U.S. help and reassurance of the American people's solidarity with Canada.	''We're all shaken by it,"" Mr. Obama said, adding that as more becomes known about the shooter's motive, that information will be factored into U.S. security considerations. ""We have to remain vigilant,"" he said.The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa was locked down as a precaution, and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington. The NYPD also increased security at the Consulate General of Canada.Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament, where Conservative and Liberal MPs were holding their weekly caucus meetings.""I'm safe locked in a office awaiting security,"" Kyle Seeback, another member of Parliament, tweeted.The top spokesman for Prime Minister Harper said Harper was safe and had left Parliament Hill. ""PM (Harper) was addressing caucus, then a huge boom, followed by rat-a-tat shots. We all scattered. It was clearly right outside our caucus door,"" Treasury Board Minister Tony Clement said, according to Reuters.A spokesman for Harper said: ""While the prime minister stated that facts are still being gathered, he condemned this despicable attack.""Canada had raised its domestic terror threat level from low to medium Tuesday because of ""an increase in general chatter from radical Islamist organizations,"" said Jean-Christophe de Le Rue, a spokesman for the public safety minister.The National Hockey League postponed Wednesday night's game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Senators because of the shootings in Ottawa.The NHL said in a statement it ""wishes to express its sympathy and prayers to all affected by the tragic events in Ottawa.""The game was scheduled at the Canadian Tire Centre in nearby Kanata.The incident comes just two days after two Canadian soldiers were run over, one of them killed, in Quebec by a man with jihadist sympathies.That suspect, 25-year-old Martin Couture Rouleau, was shot by police, and later died.Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman David Falls said Monday that the suspect ""was known to federal authorities"" and ""authorities were concerned that he had become radicalized.""The case is similar to one in London last year in which an al Qaeda-inspired extremist and another man ran over a soldier with a car before hacking the off-duty soldier to death. Images of Michael Adebolajo, 29, holding a butcher knife and cleaver with bloodied hands in the moments after the May 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby shocked people around the world and sparked fears of Islamist terrorism in Britain.The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has urged supporters to carry out attacks against Western countries, including Canada, that are participating in the U.S.-led coalition fighting the militants who have taken over large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. It was not known whether the suspect in the Quebec attack had any ties to Islamic militant groups.

""That's a go, but they are still negotiating the specifics of the  contract,"" a source within the Nevada's governor's office told  CNBC on Wednesday afternoon. The source noted that it could be a  week before the deal is official.       Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval will hold a news  conference on Thursday in Carson City to make  a ""major economic development announcement,''  according to a media advisory from the state.  Tesla spokesman Simon Sproule declined to  give details but confirmed Tesla officials  would be at the event. In July, the automaker announced that it had partnered  with Japanese electronics firm Panasonic to build the 35  GWh cell factory. It also said it would announce additional  partnerships in the coming months. Analysts at Lux Research expect the  ""gigafactory"" to reduce the cost of the Tesla Model 3 by  $2,800, which it says is ""not enough to sway the success of the  planned lower-cost EV.""   Tesla also considered California, New Mexico, Arizona and  Texas as possible locations for the factory.—CNBC.com staff. CNBC's Mark Berniker and Reuters contributed to this report.

'Who is we?' Obama says being a stay-at-home mom 'not a choice we want Americans to make'
","
Posted at 8:23 pm on October 31, 2014 by Brett T.
President Obama’s speech at Rhode Island College today flew under the media radar for the most part, but the folks at Breitbart did catch an interesting statement from the president on the lack of public pre-school. “Sometimes, someone, usually Mom, leaves the workplace to stay home with the kids, which then leaves her earning a lower wage for the rest of her life as a result,” the president told his audience. “That’s not a choice we want Americans to make.”Difference between saying ""that's not a choice we want Americans to make"" and ""that's not a choice we want Americans to have to make.""— John McCormack (@McCormackJohn) October 31, 2014As the president said, that’s not a choice “we” want Americans to make.

704,Dog found abandoned at Scottish train station with suitcase of belongings,"Scottish animal welfare charity trying to track down owner who abandoned Kai, the Shar Pei pup, leashed to a rail at Ayr stationLast modified on Wed 7 Jan 2015 13.43 GMTAn animal shelter is trying to track down the owner who abandoned a young Shar Pei at a railway station in Scotland, leaving him leashed to a rail with a suitcase full of his belongings.The Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), an animal welfare charity, said the wrinkly-faced crossbreed was discovered last Friday at Ayr railway station. His suitcase was packed with a pillow, a toy, some food and a bowl.The dog was microchipped, so the charity was able to find the dog’s name, Kai. The group was also able to track Kai’s previous owner whom the microchip was registered to.His previous owners said they sold him on the classified ads website, Gumtree, in 2013. The were unable to provide the charity with the address of the person who bought Kai.If found, the owner could be charged under Scotland’s Animal Health and Welfare Act.Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said the case highlights the unfortunate consequences of selling an animal online.“Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible,” he said “If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.”The Scottish SPCA said Kai is a “lovely dog with a nice nature”, and estimate that he is between two to three years old. The charity said it will care for the dog until they find him a permanent home.Ben Supple, a spokesman with the charity, told the Guardian on Tuesday afternoon that the prospect of Kai finding a loving home looks promising.“We haven’t as yet found a home for Kai though we’ve been inundated with offers and will ensure we find him the right owner,” Supple said.Anyone with information about Kai is urged to contact the charity’s animal helpline at 03000 999 999.",207898,728,11667,3182,127,5367,"1"

722,French police chief committed suicide after Charlie Hebdo attack ,"Limoges deputy director of regional judicial police committed suicide hours after being tasked with investigating the family of one of the Charlie Hebdo victimsA high-ranking judicial police chief in Limoges committed suicide last Wednesday hours after being asked to file a report on the Charlie Hebdo killings, it has emerged. Helric Fredou, 45, the deputy director of the regional judicial police in Limoges turned his gun on himself last Wednesday night, hours after Cherif and Said Kouachi killed 12 people in an Islamist rampage, including two policemen. He had been tasked with investigating the family of one of the victims, but died before handing in the report. He had reportedly interviewed families of Charlie Hebdo victims in the hours after the attack. It is not known if his decision to commit suicide has any link to the Charlie Hebdo killings. ""We are all stunned. He was someone who was very humane and close to people,"" said Pascal Cayla of the Alliance union. Colleagues said Mr Fredou had been deeply affected by the suicide of the number three of the Limoges judicial police in 2013 after he discovered the body. His colleague had left a note citing ""personal reasons"". Since the twin attacks last week that rocked France and left 17 people dead, there has been an outpouring of support for the country's police force, which polls regularly suggest has a poor image among many French. There were banners reading ""We love the police"" at Sunday's huge march in Paris and cities around France. ",3085291,850,25102,3289,243,9351,"0"

        Fukushima leaking radioactive water for ‘2 years, 300 tons flowing into Pacific daily’

    ","
  ""We think that the volume of water is about 300 tons a
  day,"" said Yushi Yoneyama, an official with the Minister of
  Economy, Trade and Industry, which regulates Tokyo Electric Power
  Co (TEPCO).
  
  Abe put the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry in charge of
  the situation, while demanding that the plant's operator, TEPCO
  take the necessary steps to deal with the cleanup, which is
  anticipated to take more than 40 years at a cost of US$11
  billion. 

  On Wednesday TEPCO confirmed the leak but refused to confirm the
  quantity being emitted from the plant. ""We are not currently able to say clearly how much groundwater
  is actually flowing into the ocean,"" Tokyo Electric Power
  spokesman Noriyuki Imaizumi told Reuters when asked for an
  estimate.

  Japanese authorities are working in crisis mode, attempting to
  assure the public both at home and abroad that the situation will
  not further deteriorate into a widespread environmental
  catastrophe.

  Yoneyama said the government plans to reduce the leakage amount
  to 60 tons per day by as early as December, but given the
  Japanese government’s progress in the cleanup to date that goal
  may be difficult to achieve. Removing 300 tonnes of groundwater,
  however, would not necessarily halt leakage into the sea, he
  said.
  
  The nuclear plant was severely damaged in an earthquake and
  subsequent tsunami in March 2011. About 90,000 people within a
  20km radius of the plant were forced to evacuate their homes due
  to the possibility of a full-scale nuclear meltdown.

  Earlier, TEPCO said it detected 2.35 billion becquerels of cesium
  per liter in water that is now leaking into the groundwater
  through cracks in the plant’s drainage system. This radiation
  level is roughly the same as that measured in April 2011.

  The normal level is 150 becquerels of cesium per liter of water.

  For the past two years, TEPCO has claimed that it managed to
  siphon off the excess water into specially-constructed storage
  tanks. However, the company was forced to admit late last month
  that radioactive water was still escaping into the Pacific Ocean.
  These consistent failures are testing the patience of Japanese
  authorities.

  “You can't just leave it [disposing of radioactive waste at
  the plant] up to TEPCO,"" Shinji Kinjo, head of a Nuclear
  Regulatory Authority (NRA) told Reuters. ""Right now, we have
  an emergency.""

  Earlier this month, TEPCO was forced to go on the defensive after
  a scathing first-page article appeared in The Asahi Shimbun daily
  criticizing the company’s cleanup efforts.

  “TEPCO did nothing for more than two years despite having
  pledged to seal a leaking hole between a turbine building [the
  leakage source] and an underground pit [a trench] in April 2011
  when water contaminated with radioactive materials…was found to
  have leaked into the ocean; and the company only began preparing
  for shielding tests this summer after contaminated water was
  found to be leaking into the sea this time,” the newspaper
  stated on August 1, 2013.

  TEPCO fired back with its own version of events, saying that
  despite “technical difficulties and a severe work
  environment” the company has been working to implement a plan
  “in order to further reduce the risk of having outflow of
  contaminated water beyond the trench.”

  Although TEPCO engineers have constructed a barrier between the
  destroyed facility and the ocean, it only extends 1.8 meters
  below the ground, thus water continues to accumulate inside the
  plant vaults.

  ""If you build a wall, of course the water is going to
  accumulate there. And there is no other way for the water to go
  but up or sideways and eventually lead to the ocean,"" Masashi
  Goto, a nuclear engineer who has worked at several TEPCO plants,
  told Reuters. ""So now, the question is how long do we
  have?""

  TEPCO has pledged to begin pumping enough radioactive seepage to
  stop the water level from rising. But the company faces
  limitations, as its storage tanks are 85 percent full.

  “New measures are needed to stop the water from flowing into
  the sea,"" emphasized Kinjo, who accused TEPCO of failing to
  implement long-term solutions for a crisis that has been
  continuing for more than two years.

  Not only is TEPCO running up against technical problems
  associated with the cleanup efforts, it must also deal with the
  unpredictable force of nature, specifically in the form of
  earthquakes.

  On Sunday, a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of
  Miyagi prefecture, the same northeastern region of the island
  country that was devastated by the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and
  tsunami, which resulted in 15,000 people killed and more than
  3,200 missing.

  No damage or injuries were reported in the latest earthquake, but
  some roads and railways were temporarily closed for safety
  inspections.

                Paul Walker: Remembering His Career-Defining Roles
              

","
              In the wake of the actor's tragic death, we look back on the films that made him a star.
        
          The film world is reeling from the tragic death of Paul Walker, who died in a car accident on Saturday at the age of 40. The renewed popularity of the ""Fast and Furious"" series in the years before the crash gave Walker's career a second wind, an unexpected twist for the actor who became a star at the peak of the teen movie craze of the late 90s.The two distinct phases of Walker's film career created a unique arc that also included an in-between period where he took on riskier roles, resulting in some of his best work and a career that didn't peter out like those of his former teenage contemporaries.
""Fast and Furious"" Series
As Brian O'Conner, the cop-turned-thief of the blockbuster racing series, Walker was the actor who appeared in the most installments and played in important role by bringing the audience into the world of racing for pinks and the violence that can come afterwards. With ""Fast and Furious 7"" already filming and plans for eighth and ninth installments coming together, it was likely that Walker's presence in the series would have continued for years to come.

""She's All That"" (1999)
During the late 90s, teen-centric dramedies experienced a big comeback, and one of the movies that came to embody that trend was undoubtedly ""She's All That."" Walker's role in the film highlighted his almost-too-handsome looks, as he played Dean Sampson, the jock friend of Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character and the guy who started the plot to turn an art nerd into prom queen in the first place.

""Varsity Blues"" (1999)
Like the movie itself, Walker in ""Varsity Blues"" was able to show off the darker side of a character and a story that we thought we knew. As Lance Harbor, the injured quarterback of a small-town Texas team, he took on material that wasn't totally new for him, but by the end of the movie, it was a distinct and memorable performance that would stand on its own.

""Pleasantville"" (1998)
Though movies like ""She's All That"" and ""Varsity Blues"" made Walker an important part of 90s movie culture, his role in ""Pleasantville"" proved that he also fit pretty well in a time long before that. The Tobey Maguire-Reese Witherspoon film from future ""Hunger Games"" director Gary Ross took two modern teenagers into a 1950s sitcom, complete with the perfect all-American boy, as played by Walker. His charm and dedication to the part brought an outlandish character to life in a relatable way.

""Running Scared"" (2006)
In the six years between ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and Walker's return to the series in ""Fast & Furious,"" he took on more challenging material that may not have sold as many tickets as the ones where he played Brian O'Conner, but ""Running Scared,"" along with Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" showed more of his range, while still playing to the strengths that audiences were familiar with. ""Running Scared"" casts Walker as a low-level mob enforcer who gets thrown into one hell of a bad night, as the gun he is tasked with hunting down keeps slipping away from him and his simple task becomes more complicated than he could have imagined.

 
""Fast and Furious"" SeriesAs Brian O'Conner, the cop-turned-thief of the blockbuster racing series, Walker was the actor who appeared in the most installments and played in important role by bringing the audience into the world of racing for pinks and the violence that can come afterwards. With ""Fast and Furious 7"" already filming and plans for eighth and ninth installments coming together, it was likely that Walker's presence in the series would have continued for years to come.""She's All That"" (1999)During the late 90s, teen-centric dramedies experienced a big comeback, and one of the movies that came to embody that trend was undoubtedly ""She's All That."" Walker's role in the film highlighted his almost-too-handsome looks, as he played Dean Sampson, the jock friend of Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character and the guy who started the plot to turn an art nerd into prom queen in the first place.""Varsity Blues"" (1999)Like the movie itself, Walker in ""Varsity Blues"" was able to show off the darker side of a character and a story that we thought we knew.

789,President of Argentina adopts Jewish godson to 'stop him turning into a werewolf',"Your account has been createdThe tradition to stop stigma about the 'lobison' has continued for a centuryFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileThe President of Argentina has adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to ""stop him turning into a werewolf"", according to tradition.President Christina Fernández de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family at her office last week to mark the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years.According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared “el lobison”.The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma.Starting in 1907, the tradition was formally established by a decree in 1973 by Juan Domingo Peron, which also extended the practice to baby girls.Seventh sons or daughters – now much rarer than 100 years ago – gain the President as their official godparent as well as a gold medal and full educational scholarship.Even now, reports of dog-like creatures attacking livestock continue, as does the tradition.Ms Fernandez said Yair is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the tradition only applied to Catholic children until 2009.She described her meeting with him and his family on 23 December as a “magical moment”.Calling the Tawils a “marvellous family” she described Yair as “a total sweety” and dubbed his mother “Queen Esther.”Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, had written the President a letter in 1993 and got their wish this year, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported, attending the ceremony with their son and three of his brothers.Pictures showed them lighting Hanukkah candles together on a menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family.Update: An Argentine historian has since told the Guardian that the local lobison myth and the tradition of the seventh child becoming the President's godchild are not related. However, in Portuguese folklore the last-born of a series of seven or nine siblings is in danger of becoming a werewolf or a witch.Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

        Radioactive water overruns Fukushima barrier - TEPCO

    ","Follow RT’s LIVE UPDATES on Fukushima leak
  emergency
  The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which is responsible
  for decommissioning the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant,
  on Saturday said the protective barriers that were installed to
  prevent the flow of toxic water into the ocean are no longer
  coping with the groundwater levels, Itar-Tass reports.
  
  The contaminated groundwater, which mixes with radioactive leaks
  seeping out of the plant, has already risen to 60cm above the
  barriers – the fact which TEPCO calls a major cause of the
  massive daily leak of toxic substances. 

  Earlier on Friday, the company announced it started pumping out
  contaminated groundwater from under Fukushima, and managed to
  pump out 13 tons of water in six hours on Friday. TEPCO also said
  it plans to boost the pumped-out amount to some 100 tons a day
  with the help of a special system, which will be completed by
  mid-August. This will be enough to seal off most of the ongoing
  ocean contamination, according to TEPCO’s estimates.

  However, Japan’s Ministry of Industry has recently estimated that some 300 tons of contaminated
  groundwater have been flowing into the ocean daily ever since the
  March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that triggered the
  disaster. 

  TEPCO also promised it will urgently reinforce the protective
  shields to keep radioactive leaks at bay. The company has
  repeatedly complained it is running out of space and has had to
  resort to pumping water into hastily-built tanks of questionable
  reliability, as more than 20,000 tons of water with high
  levels of radioactive substances has accumulated in the plant’s
  drainage system. 

  Water samples recently taken at an underground passage below the
  Fukushima nuclear plant showed extreme levels of radiation comparable
  to those taken immediately after the March 2011 catastrophe. The
  tested water, which had been mixing with ground water and flowing
  into the ocean, contained 2.35 billion Becquerels of cesium per
  liter – some 16 million times above the limit.

818,Microsoft to buy Mojang for $2 billion - report	,"
												UPDATE: Notch initiated buyout and will leave once complete, source says.					UPDATE 10/9/14 9.55am: Minecraft creator Markkus ""Notch"" Persson instigated talks with Microsoft to sell developer Mojang, a new source has claimed, and will leave the company for good when the deal is complete.That's according to a new Bloomberg report, which claims that Persson was attracted to the idea of a deal after striking up a close relationship with recently-promoted Xbox chief Phil Spencer.The positive experience of working with Microsoft on the hugely successful Xbox versions of Minecraft is also said to be a factor.But Minecraft is also now available on PlayStation 4 and PS3 and a Vita edition is also due for release. It's unclear what would happen to the ongoing development of the game on Sony's platforms in the event of a Microsoft buyout.Both parties have so far declined to comment on the reports.ORIGINAL STORY 9/9/14 11.55Pm: Microsoft is allegedly nearing a deal to acquire Mojang, the creator of Minecraft and Scrolls, for $2 billion.According to the Wall Street Journal, this deal could be finalised as early as this week.Minecraft has gone on to sell 50 million copies since its release in 2009, while Mojang made $100 million in profits last year. This would be a surprising move, if it happens, because Mojang founder Markkus ""Notch"" Persson has always been critical of giant corporations. In fact, he cancelled the Oculus version of Minecraft once the VR company sold to Facebook.Microsoft is continuing its long and storied tradition of not commenting on rumours or speculation, and we've reached out to Mojang and will update should the studio shed more light on the matter.Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

            Malaysian airliner shot down over Ukraine
        ","Malaysian airliner shot down over UkraineA Malaysian passenger plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine by militants on Thursday, killing all 295 people aboard, a Ukrainian interior ministry official was quoted as saying by Interfax-Ukraine news agency.Anton Gerashchenko said the aircraft, which other sources said was a Boeing 777 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, came down near the city of Donetsk, a stronghold of pro-Russian rebels, adding that it was hit by a ground-to-air missile.European flight safety body Eurocontrol said Thursday that Ukrainian authorities have closed the airspace over the east of the country following the crash.See also: Obama, Putin discuss Malaysia plane incidentBritain seeking urgent U.N. meeting over Ukraine The tragic history of shot-down civilian aircraft In a response, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called the crash a ""terrorist act,"" and called for an international investigation to be held.“We do not exclude that the plane was shot down and confirm that the Ukraine Armed Forces did not fire at any targets in the sky,” Poroshenko said.U.S. President Barack Obama called the crash a “terrible tragedy,” and said that his administration was working to confirm if Americans were on board.Russia's U.N. envoy denied involvement in the crash.  “We didn't do it,” Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.Malaysia Airlines earlier said it had ""lost contact"" with MH-17 whose last known position was over Ukraine.  ""Malaysia Airlines has lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam,"" the airline, still reeling from the disappearance of flight MH370, said on its Twitter account. ""The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace,"" it said, adding that it would provide more details soon.   Interfax-Ukraine quoted another Ukrainian official as saying the plane disappeared from radar when it was flying at 10,000 meters (33,000 feet), a typical cruising altitude for airliners.  It came down at Torez, near Shakhtersk, some 40 km (25 miles) from the Russia border. The area has been the scene of fighting between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian rebels.Dozens of bodies were scattered around the smouldering wreckage of a passenger jet that crashed in eastern Ukraine on Thursday, a Reuters reporter said, while both Reuters and Agence France-Presse reported seeing no survivors. At least four French nationals were on board.As plumes of black smoke rose up near a rebel-held village of Grabovo in eastern Ukraine, an Associated Press journalist counted at least 22 bodies at the crash site 40 kilometers from the Russian border.The plane appeared to have broken up before impact and the burning wreckage - including body parts and the belongings of passengers - was scattered over a wide area.An emergency services rescue worker said at least 100 bodies had so far been found at the scene, near the village of Grabovo, and that debris from the wreckage was scattered across an area up to about 15 km (nine miles) in diameter.Broken pieces of the wings were marked with blue and red paint - the same colours as the emblem of the Malaysian airline which earlier this year lost track of a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was carrying almost 300 people. Ukraine has accused Russia of taking an active role in the four-month-old conflict in recent days.On Wednesday evening, a Ukrainian fighter jet was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a Russian plane, Ukrainian authorities said, according to Associated Press.Security Council spokesman Andrei Lysenko said the pilot of the Sukhoi-25 jet hit by the air-to-air missile was forced to bail after his jet was shot down.  Pro-Russia rebels, meanwhile, claimed responsibility for strikes Wednesday on two Ukrainian Sukhoi-25 jets. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the second jet was hit by a portable surface-to-air missile, but added the pilot was unscathed and managed to land his plane safely  Moscow denies Western charges that is supporting the separatists or sowing unrest in its neighbor.   Earlier this week, Ukraine said a military transport plane was shot down Monday by a missile fired from Russian territory.  The rebels are known to possess portable anti-aircraft rocket launchers, but Ukrainian officials say that kind of weapon would have been unable to reach Monday's plane at the altitude at which it was flying Monday.Aviation experts, however, have questioned whether the stricken transport plane was flying at the altitude Ukrainian officials had claimed.

        The military can't take away the salary of Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist charged in the deadly 2009 Fort Hood shooting, until he has been convicted. (AP)The Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others during a shooting at Fort Hood has reportedly been paid more than $278,000 since the 2009 incident.U.S. Department of Defense officials confirmed to NBCDFW.com that Maj. Nidal Hasan’s salary cannot be suspended unless he is proven guilty in the Nov. 5, 2009, shooting in Texas, citing the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin May 30.If Hasan, 42, had been a civilian Defense Department employee, Army officials could have suspended his pay after just seven days, NBCDFW.com reports.A military judge refused to delay Hasan’s trial earlier this month after his attorneys sought to postpone the court-martial to Sept. 1. Hasan’s attorneys claimed military jurors may be influenced by national media coverage of the Boston Marathon bombings that compared the two Muslim suspects -- Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev – to Hasan.Prosecutors countered that the delay was unnecessary because Hasan was mentioned only briefly in some news reports about the April 15 attacks in Boston. Hasan faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole if convicted of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder.The White House and Pentagon have refused to characterize Hasan's attack as terrorism, instead terming it “workplace violence.” The victims have been denied Purple Hearts and are suing the military because they claim the ""workplace violence"" designation gives them diminished access to medical care and financial benefits normally available to those whose wounds are designated as ""combat related.""Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

899,#BBCTrending: Will anchor who quit succeed in business?,"By BBC Trending  What's popular and whyOld and new media came to a head in Alaska this week: a local news reporter presented an edited package on the evening news about the campaign to legalise marijuana, then revealed her identity as the owner of a medical marijuana business.Then, with the cameras rolling, she quit her job, uttered a profanity, and walked off the set, leaving the anchor stunned and fumbling before a commercial break. Ethical issues aside, Greene's sign off is having a bigger impact on social media than any local news spot could. More than two million people have seen the video on YouTube. Twenty thousand people have tweeted about it, and it's made headlines across the globe.But one business consultant wonders if it will have lasting impact.""Just because something is viral doesn't mean it's paying the bills, and that's a really important point,"" says Peter Shankman, author of Can We Do That?! Outrageous PR Stunts That Work. ""She might have seven million Facebook views tomorrow, but guess what? No one's buying her stuff, because they're all outside of Alaska,"" he says. While Greene's stunt was being discussed on CNN, her Indiegogo fund to raise $5,000 to campaign for Alaska's marijuana legalisation act had barely made it past the halfway mark. She had yet to raise the full amount by the end of the business day on the East Coast. While the stunt will be the first thing that pops up when someone searches for her online, the Twitter feed for her business, Alaska Cannabis Club, has fewer than 700 followers and its Facebook page has less than 6,000 - that's more than two-thirds fewer than the Facebook page of KTVA, the news station she quit in spectacular fashion. In the meantime, her immediate community - and her client base - may have questions about credibility.  ""I don't think she was thinking long term,"" Shankman says. ""This was a very short term play."" Comments online indicate that the renegade spirit she showed in quitting is appreciated by fans of marijuana culture. Whether that translates to more customers or more votes for pro-pot legislation remains to be seen.

915,Federal sources confirm identity of slain Ottawa gunman,"Advertisement
	OTTAWA -- A gunman turned the nation's capital into an armed camp Wednesday after he fatally shot an honour guard at ""point-blank"" range at the National War Memorial before setting his sights on Parliament Hill.
	The extraordinary scene ended with the assailant shot dead in the polished marble halls of Parliament's Centre Block, apparently by the sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons, while SWAT teams combed the busy parliamentary precinct in an ultimately fruitless search for accomplices.
	Prime Minister Stephen Harper capped the day's stunning events with a rare live televised address, calling the tragedy a terrorist attack that he said would only redouble Canada's efforts to combat fight terrorism at home and abroad.
	Slain reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo of Hamilton, Ont., is the second member of the Armed Forces this week to die in an apparently random, murderous attack, just as Canadian war planes are being deployed to Iraq.
	Two Canadian soldiers were run over -- one of them fatally -- in Quebec on Monday by a man with jihadist sympathies.
	The slain shooter was identified as Michael Zehaf Bibeau, born in 1982 and known to police in Montreal and Vancouver.
	""It's way too early to be able to determine a motive,"" Gilles Michaud, the assistant commissioner of the RCMP, said at a news conference in Ottawa while police were still clearing downtown buildings.
	But the prime minister, who was in the Centre Block addressing a Conservative caucus meeting when the attack began just outside the door, later took to the national airwaves to unequivocally characterize the shooter's true motives.
	""Fellow Canadians, in the days to come we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had,"" Harper said.
	""But this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.""
	Attacks on Canadian security personnel and governing institutions, he said, are ""by their very nature, attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.""
	Tony Zobl, 35, witnessed Cirillo being gunned down at the War Memorial from his fourth-floor office window directly above the monument, just before 10 a.m. Wednesday.
	""I looked out the window and saw a shooter -- a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well -- holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph, point blank, twice,"" Zobl told The Canadian Press.
	""It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun,"" he continued. ""The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""
	Zobl said the shooter then ran up the street toward Parliament Hill.
	It was only earlier this year that the government extended the season for live guards at the monument through the November Remembrance Day ceremonies. In the past, the honour guard has stood down after Labour Day.
	The scene on Parliament Hill was frantic.
	Wednesday morning is the busiest day of the week on the Hill, with MPs and senators of all major parties gathering in the Centre Block for meetings.
	Given the time and day, it was remarkable only four persons were admitted to hospital. One was Cirillo, and the other three were all released Wednesday evening. Only one had a minor gunshot wound.
	Witnesses and video suggest a hail of gunfire erupted in the marbled Hall of Honour that bisects the building directly beneath the Peace Tower.
	Kevin Vickers, better known to political wonks as the ceremonially garbed sergeant-at-arms carrying the mace to open the Commons each day, was reported by multiple sources as the person who shot the gunman.
	Construction worker Scott Walsh said he was in a manhole near the East Block building, between the memorial and the Centre Block, when he heard two gunshots echo down the street.
	In the ensuing panic, people around him started screaming, including a woman pushing a child in a stroller.
	He said she started to run, so he went to help her.
	That's when he saw a man with long black hair, his face covered by a white scarf with decals on it and wearing a black jacket.
	""He had a double-barrelled shotgun, he was about five feet from me, and he ran right beside us, ran past the woman with the stroller and child,"" he said.
	The gunman then hijacked a car at gunpoint, he said, and drove it up towards the Peace Tower.
	Greta Levy, a press secretary for the NDP, said she had just left the building when she saw the gunman walk up the paved ramp under the tower.
	""None of us reacted at first but then we heard a security guard yelling, 'There's a gun, get down, get down, there's a gun,""' Levy said.
	""And I looked up, as did the woman I was with, and saw a man that I would describe as young, 20s-30s, coming up the ramp as though to go in the main doors of Centre Block under the Peace Tower.""
	The incident paralyzed the entire downtown core for hours, from the adjacent U.S. embassy to the University of Ottawa several city blocks to the south.
	Sources say police at one point worried there could be up to five assailants, and they combed rooftops of nearby buildings in addition to the full lockdown.
	The incident shattered the sleepy tenor of a capital that has been remarkably immune from attack through more than a decade of tumultuous overseas wars.
	""I feared this day would come, and my prayers are with the fallen soldier,"" senior cabinet minister Tony Clement posted on Twitter while locked in the caucus room. ""Hug your fam.""
	""It's a stomach-turning, shocking day for all Canadians,"" Marc Garneau, a former Forces member and now Liberal foreign affairs critic, said in an interview.
	The Hill is known as an open public space that's used for everything from mass yoga classes to hazy pot-legalization demonstrations.
	""I think the intention was to try to make Parliament not look like Fort Knox,"" said Garneau. ""But we've crossed a river today.""
	Green party Leader Elizabeth May urged restraint.
	""Today is not a day that 'changes everything,""' May said in a statement. ""It is a day of tragedy. We must ensure we keep our responses proportionate to whatever threat remains.""
	Military bases have been put on alert and soldiers have been cautioned about wearing uniforms in public.
	In Toronto, the country's largest city, extra police where put on the streets and public buildings were on alert.
	Jan Lugtenborg, a tourist from the Netherlands, was at the War Memorial and able to describe the shooter in detail.
	""We heard four shots,"" said Lugtenborg.
	""You don't expect that when you're on holiday in Canada.""

The first photos of the Oklahoma woman, who was allegedly beheaded by a Muslim convert last week at the food distribution plant where she worked, have emerged on social media.The photos of 54-year-old Colleen Hufford show a woman who doted on her family. Relatives set up the Facebook memorial page describing her as an affectionate grandmother who always had a smile on her face.“Someday I’ll see you again,” reads a backdrop on the page, which was created to celebrate the life of the Vaughan Foods employee who was murdered last Thursday.Pictures posted to the memorial page depict a life surrounded by family as Hufford is photographed cradling a baby, relaxing with her husband and enjoying a beautiful autumn day with family.A memorial fund was also setup on the FundMe website in Hufford’s honor and has already received $662 in pledges.“She was a loyal wife, mother and a doting grandmother,” the page description reads. “This memorial fund is being set up to help her husband KC, and daughter Kelli with her funeral services and if possible to help with Colleen’s granddaughter Riley’s college fund.”Hufford’s co-worker — Alton Nolen — allegedly snapped and attacked Hufford just hours after getting fired from his job last Thursday at the food distribution plant in Moore. Co-workers told police that the 30-year-old had attempted to convert them to Islam.Share Selection",481205,839,7358,4083,550,6418,"1"
926,Microsoft to buy Mojang - report,"You are not signed in.Rachel WeberSenior EditorTuesday 9th September 2014Share this articleCompanies in this articleMicrosoftMojangUpdate: Mojang founder Markus ""Notch"" Persson may have instigated the negotiations with Microsoft, after reaching out to the company several months ago.Many within the games industry and the games press have reacted with surprise at the possibility of Microsoft acquiring Mojang, not least because Persson has been openly critical of the company in the past. However, Bloomberg's sources have claimed that Persson actually proposed the deal in the first place, largely due to a ""positive working relationship"" and a ""close relationship"" with Xbox boss Phil Spencer.According to Bloomberg, Persson will remain at Mojang to see the deal and subsequent merger through to completion, but will likely depart once that has happened.Original Story: Unconfirmed reports suggest that Microsoft could be about to secure a massive deal with the purchase of Minecraft studio Mojang.Neither Mojang or Microsoft have made any public announcement regarding the story but the Wall Street Journal cites ""a person with knowledge of the matter"" who claims the sale is worth $2 billion and could be signed and sealed this week.The news is unexpected, Mojang has always seemed to be a company that prided itself on its independence with Minecraft creator Markus ""Notch"" Persson as its outspoken leader.In March it was revealed that Mojang made $129 million in profit in 2013, so it's not hard to see why Microsoft might be interested.GamesIndustry.biz has contacted Mojang for clarification and will update this story as it develops. Developers are already reacting to the news on social media sites, and the reaction has been one of disbelief and caution as yet.My guess is that MS approached Mojang, Mojang hasn't responded but MS leaked that they'd reached out to gauge/build buzz.Rumours of Microsoft buying Mojang for B? Outrage to the tune of â€œthink of how many indie studios could be funded with that!â€ in 3â€¦ 2â€¦

937,Hewlett-Packard Announces Breakup Plan as Technology Landscape Shifts,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Quentin Hardy and David GellesHewlett-Packard confirmed on Monday that it planned to break into two companies.The company, considered a foundational institution of Silicon Valley, said in a news release that it intended to divide itself into a company aimed at business technology, including computer servers and data storage equipment, software and services, and a company that sells personal computers and printers.Both companies will be publicly traded. The business-oriented company will be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, while the PC company will be called HP Inc. and will retain the company’s current logo. The transaction is expected to be completed by October 2015, the end of HP’s fiscal year, the company said.In a statement, Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive, said the company was splitting up to “more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market.”While Ms. Whitman, who became chief executive in 2011, depicted the historic decision as a natural part of her five-year turnaround plan, she had previously resisted the idea of breaking up the company. HP was one of the world’s top buyers of semiconductors and other computer parts, she had argued, giving it pricing power superior to its rivals.Dividing in two, she said on Monday, “will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics.” This will make HP more competitive, she said.Ms. Whitman will retain much power at both companies. She will be chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and will serve as nonexecutive chairman of HP Inc. Patricia F. Russo, currently a director of HP, will be chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Dion Weisler, now head of HP’s printing business, will be president and chief executive of HP Inc.The company also added to the number of prospective job cuts. In an earlier conference call with analysts, it said it had “identified opportunities for incremental improvements” in its plan to eliminate a total of 50,000 jobs through layoffs and retirements. It now expects the number to be 55,000.The company said its financial analysts’ meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, had been postponed.“HP’s board and management have made a brilliant value-enhancing move at the perfect time in the turnaround,” Ralph V. Whitworth, founder of Relational Investors and a former Hewlett chairman, said in a statement on Monday. “The new companies will be better positioned to address today’s light-speed market dynamics and customer needs, and with distinct and compelling financial profiles and strong leadership teams, accelerate growth and shareholder value creation.”The company’s shares closed up 4.7 percent Monday at $36.87, a gain of $1.67.In a little over a year, stalwarts like Microsoft, IBM and Dell have changed chief executives, sold big parts of their businesses or gone private. All of them, along with a host of other companies that became behemoths during a 20-year boom in personal computing and the Internet, are rushing to cope with the rise in mobile devices connected to cloud systems.Cloud computing uses software to turn numerous computer servers, sometimes a million or more, into single entities. These flexible systems can distribute work with greater efficiency, cutting the overall need for servers, and interact easily with other computers, whether in clouds, PCs, or mobile devices.Winners in the new landscape include Apple, the king of consumer electronics, with annual revenue of $170 billion. The company makes iPhones, iPads, and hosts through its online stores a wealth of cloud-based software applications. South Korea’s Samsung, the other big winner in smartphones, has dominated the competition, forcing onetime leader Nokia into a sale of its phone business to Microsoft.In business computing, Amazon’s cloud-based rentals of computer power and software to businesses, Amazon Web Services, has sharply lowered the cost of starting a company and hosts businesses like Netflix, Pinterest, and Airbnb. Many established businesses also use Amazon Web Services, which is estimated to have well over a million computer servers. Google has built online word processing and spreadsheet businesses that threaten Microsoft, and is challenging Amazon Web Services for the corporate cloud business.HP was long the world’s largest computer company, though there has been much turmoil in recent years. The two businesses resulting from the proposed split almost evenly divide HP’s fiscal 2013 revenue of $112 billion. On their own, both would easily fit in the top half of the Fortune 500.HP’s split is not the first time the company has hewed itself in two to cope with changing times. In 1999, its test and measurement equipment division was started as a separate company, called Agilent. Shares in Agilent rose 41 percent on their first day, and the company was completely spun off HP in 2000. The stock was already declining by then, however, and today Agilent has a market capitalization about equal with its first day’s value.Agilent, as the name suggests, was also split off in the interests of agility, at that time in the face of the first Internet boom. While HP benefited in those years from PC and server sales, management also felt the company was not moving fast enough for a changing world.Advertisement",50400802,845,567930,1092,143,5976,"1"

    Soldiers were on the base as part of a training programDEVELOPING: Three Afghan National Army soldiers who vanished from a Cape Cod military base where they had been taking part in a training exercise have been found at the Canadian border near Niagara Falls, a senior Pentagon official told Fox News.The men were reported missing by the Massachusetts National Guard Saturday night at Joint Base Cape Cod. A statement identified the soldiers as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, 48, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, 18, and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar, 20.""They have been found,"" the source said. The men were found near Rainbow Bridge, which spans New York and Ontario, but no other details were immediately available.A federal source told MyFoxBoston.com the men were caught at the border on Monday.Earlier, Pentagon officials who spoke to Fox News said they did not feel that the missing soldiers posed a public threat. U.S. military officials told The Associated Press that the men arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11. They were last seen during a day off at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady told the Cape Cod Times that the men “had the freedom to come and go.”""If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall,” he said.Base and exercise officials were working with local and state authorities to locate the soldiers, who were taking part in a U.S. Central Command Regional Cooperation exercise.The exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.Col. George Harrington, battle group commander for the exercise, told the Cape Cod Times that the day the soldiers disappeared was a chance for participants to visit Cape Cod beaches and be treated to a traditional lobster boil back on the base.This year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations, including the U.S., wraps up on Wednesday. There are about a dozen Afghan soldiers still taking part in the exercise.A Cape Cod Times reporter who attended a training exercise on Friday observed that none of the soldiers involved were carrying weapons.This year is the first time the exercise has taken place on U.S. soil since 2006, the Cape Cod Times reported. The events are usually held in South Asia.""This is a valuable opportunity for the Massachusetts National Guard and is personally rewarding,"" Harrington told the newspaper.Click for more from the Cape Cod Times.Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

The 92-year-old is alive and well, but a satirical article on Empire News sparked rumors that the world lost the witty actress after readers misconstrued a little wordplay in the headline.The story read, ""Actress Betty White, 92, Dyes Peacefully In Her Los Angeles Home,"" and many didn't realize that the writer used a homophone for dies.PHOTOS: 2014's Fallen StarsClearly, fans didn't continue reading the article, because the entire thing was a tongue-in-cheek ""interview"" with the star's agent about how White's not a natural blond, along with purported quotes from Betty, herself, about her brunette to blond transformation.""Oh, I started dying it ages ago when my color started to fade away to a more whiteish, greyish color,"" White supposedly said. ""I thought to myself, ‘Well Betty, if you can't have the dark color anymore, might as well try on the blonde for a while,' and it just kind of stuck. When I played Rose on Girls, the joke about my natural hair color made it into several episodes. I've always had a sense of humor about it.""White's agent, Jeff Witjas, assured the Los Angeles Times that the actress was alive and well.

        Water leaks at Fukushima could contaminate entire Pacific Ocean

    ","RT:Japanese officials have admitted a leak at
  Fukushima has been happening for two years and is worse than
  earlier thought. Why did it take so long to evaluate the actual
  repercussions of the tragedy and take decisive measures to tackle
  them?HW: The Japanese authorities have been covering up the
  true depth of the disaster because they don’t want to embarrass
  themselves and the global nuclear industry and they are trying to
  open up another nuclear plant in Japan. When the Japanese people
  now find out that the accident is worse than we thought and they
  have been leaking many tons of radioactive water into the Pacific
  Ocean for almost two and a half years, this is a catastrophe.
  Tokyo Electric has no idea how to control this accident. This is
  absolutely terrifying after two and a half years. To find out
  that these reactors have been out of control, now that they can’t
  control this they don’t know what’s going on. This is not a
  primitive backward country; this is Japan with advanced
  technology. It has very serious implications for nuclear power
  all over the world.
RT:Why the plant's operator failed to contain the
  leak?HW: Because they don’t know what to do. This has never
  happened before. You have three explosions; you have four nuclear
  reactors that are severely compromised. No one ever planned for
  this. This is an apocalyptic event. This is something that could
  contaminate the entire Pacific Ocean. It is extremely serious.
  The reality is that Tokyo Electric does not know what is
  happening and does not know how to control what is going on. Our
  entire planet is at risk here. This is two and a half years after
  these explosions and they are still in the dark. It’s terrifying.
  
      Prof. Christopher Busby, to the contrary, believes that
      ""the Pacific Ocean is big enough for this
      level of release not to represent the global catastrophe that
      some are predicting"" and provides his calculations
      in his article on RT.com.
      RT:An estimated 300 tonnes of contaminated water is
  spilling daily into the ocean. How come Tepco insists the leaks
  still pose no big threat to the environment?HW: They are lying; they can’t face the reality of this
  situation. When have very serious quantities of radiation going
  into the Pacific Ocean. There is no medical or epidemiological or
  scientific basis for estimating how much damage this will cost.
  We are on entirely new ground here and this cannot go by without
  a serious impact on the entire human race. This is a terrible
  tragedy.
  RT:The clean-up was previously on Tepco 
  alone. Why didn't the government step in earlier? Rectifying an
  accident like the one at Fukushima needs a comprehensive
  approach, doesn't it?HW: The problem is that the company does not want to admit
  how serious this is and the government of Japan doesn’t want to
  admit how serious this is. And even if the government of Japan
  steps in, they don’t know what to do. This particular
  administration in Japan wants to open the other nuclear plants.
  50 nuclear plants have been shut in Japan since the accident and
  they want to reopen them. This is very political, because if they
  admit to how bad the things are in Fukushima the public is not
  going to stand for them re opening other nuclear plants,
  including some that are owned by Tokyo Electric Power. How do you
  have a huge utility company on one hand saying that we can’t
  control all these 300 tons of radioactive liquid going into the
  Pacific Ocean every day, and on the other hand we want you to let
  us open these other nuclear reactors? This is a catastrophe for
  them and that’s why they have been lying about it because they
  want to open other nuclear plants but they don’t want the public
  to know how serious the damage is in Fukushima.
RT:According to some estimates it will take 40 years
  to clean-up the contaminated area. Why so long?HW: That is not long enough. It will never be cleaned up.
  We have materials there that are radioactive, that are harmful,
  and that are dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years. They
  can talk about cleaning it up in 40 years but it will never be
  cleaned up. You will never be able to go back on that site. The
  radioactivity will be in the waters forever.
RT:What long-term impact of the radiation leak on
  Japan and its neighbouring countries we should expect in the
  future?HW: There are serious health impacts. People will be
  harmed. We are seeing 40% rate of thyroid damage among children
  in the area and this is a huge impact and it will go up, not
  down. More and more radiation is escaping from the water and
  tritium into the atmosphere. And radiation to the thyroid is very
  serious, especially among small children and we are already
  seeing a 40% rate. People will be suffering for hundreds of
  years. I interviewed people in central Pennsylvania a year after
  the accident and discovered tremendous health impacts among the
  people there. We know that Chernobyl did tremendous damage to
  people in Belarus and Ukraine and now we are going to see it
  again in Fukushima.

1006,'Madden NFL 15' Predicts Super Bowl Patriots Victory - Right Down To The Score,"A couple days ago, I posted about EA Sports' Madden NFL 15 Super Bowl XLIX prediction.I had no idea the video game simulation would be so accurate.Not only did Madden predict a New England Patriots victory over the Seattle Seahawks, the game predicted the final score of 28-24.That's very nearly as perfect a Super Bowl prediction as you're likely to find, and it spurs the game's big game track record to 9-3.Not bad, for a video game.The Madden prediction also saw the Patriots making a second half comeback for the win. It also predicted Tom Brady as MVP, with 335 yards and four touchdowns.Brady's actual numbers? Just seven yards short of the prediction with 328 yards passing and four touchdowns. That's...crazy.The game also predicted Edelman's winning touchdown and was surprisingly close in a number of other key stats.What the video game didn't anticipate were the final moments of the Super Bowl, which ended not with a bang but with a whimper.There was no way the video game could predict the awesome, unexpected reception by receiver Jermaine Kearse.And nobody could have seen that final interception. I mean, who makes a call like that? Not in a video game and certainly not in real life.Either way, talk about an incredible prediction from EA Sports and Madden NFL 15. I'm not sure anyone else came this close.Check out the original prediction and video here.Erik Kain writes a widely read and respected blog about video games, entertainment and  culture at Forbes.

1024,'Beverly Hillbillies' star Donna Douglas dies at 82,"Donna Douglas, who played hillbilly bombshell Elly May Clampett on the baby-boomer-beloved 1960s sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies, has died. She was 82.Charlene Smith, her niece-in-law, confirmed Friday to USA TODAY that she died of pancreatic cancer on New Year's Day at Baton Rouge General Hospital, near her home in Zachary, La.The Baton Rouge paper, The Advocate and other media outlets, including local TV station WAFB , also confirmed her death, although most put her age at 81.""She was 82,"" Smith said firmly, adding jokingly, ""She's going to haunt me for that.""Douglas' death leaves only one member of the show's original cast still alive: Max Baer Jr., who played Elly May's cousin, Jethro. He is 77.""She was Elly May until the day she died,"" Baer told the website RumorFix. ""When I saw her for autograph signings or other gatherings, she always dressed the same with pink or blue"" and of course those signature pigtails.""He said he last saw Douglas in January 2013 for an autograph signing in Los Angeles. He said she had pancreatic cancer for the last months of her life.""But she was a very private person — nothing like me."" A friend told him Donna had a message for him: ""Tell Maxie I thought I was going to get better.""Smith described Douglas as a ""very good Christian lady. We all loved her,"" she said. ""Whenever she gave presents, they always came with (passages) from Scripture.""Douglas, a former Miss Baton Rouge and Miss New Orleans, was born in Pride, La., and returned to live in Zachary, after her time in Hollywood, to be near her only child, son Danny Bourgeois. She is survived by him, by three grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, one brother and other extended family members, Smith said.She was married and divorced twice, including the second time, to The Beverly Hillbillies director, Robert Leeds.Smith said the family plans a private funeral.Douglas grew up in Pride and attended a local Catholic high school, where she played softball and basketball, and was a member of the school's first graduating class.But she'll always be known as Elly May — the tomboy-but-sweetly sexy blond Clampett daughter who never seemed to be aware of her effect on men, and who referred to their Beverly Hills mansion swimming pool as the ""SEE-ment pond.""In many ways, she was Elly May, with her own real-life rags-to-riches story.""Oh, yeah, it was just like a slice out of my life,"" she told The Advocate in an interview a few years ago."" I knew everything about Elly.""And she didn't mind the association, either. ""So many kinds of people relate to Elly May,"" Douglas said, according to the Associated Press. ""So many people love her, and that means a lot to me.""Douglas also will be remembered as co-starring opposite Elvis Presley in the 1966 film Frankie and Johnny, and for an especially creepy Twilight Zone episode, ""The Eye of the Beholder.""The Beverly Hillbillies was a classic fish-out-of water comedy about a poor backwoods Ozark family transplanted to California after striking oil (""black gold"" as the banjo-inflected theme song went) on their land.Starring Buddy Ebsen as Jed Clampett (he died in 2003) and Irene Ryan (she died in 1973) as Granny, the show ran for nine years on CBS, from 1962 to 1971. It consistently ranked in the top most-watched programs on TV during its run, even though critics didn't care for it.After Hillbillies ended, Douglas worked in real estate, recorded country and gospel music albums and wrote a book for children that drew on biblical themes.In 2010 she sued CBS and toymaker Mattel seeking some of the proceeds from sales of a Barbie doll that used Elly May's name and likeness. The suit was settled in 2011.To this day, many boomers can sing the theme song by heart. But even some non-boomers expressed appreciation on Twitter at the news of Douglas' death.",4421628,886,31153,2980,99,5695,"1"

By nobody has seen these shots,"" Mr Kartopolov added.He said that a US satellite was present over Ukraine territory at the time of the crash and and would like American authorities to release these images to the ""world community for further investigation.""The audience was shown graphics and video that purport to be three civilian aircrafts flying at the same time at MH17, including a Copenhagen to Singapore flight.  “Ukrainian officials reported that on the day of the Boeing 777 crash there were no military aircraft available in the region, so as you can see, this doesn’t appear to be true.”He said that Ukraine had self-propelled, anti-aircraft BUK missile launchers 8km north-western from Lugansk, close to the territory controlled by the rebels and that images show it was present on 14 July, but absent on 17 July.He also denied that the Russian military had supplied pro-Moscow rebels with any weapons, according to journalists tweeting from the meeting.Sweden’s Foreign Minister Carl Bildt has tweeted: “There are those who remember press conference where Soviet Ministry of Defence denied everything concerning shooting down of KAL007.”Koren Airlines KAL007 was a passenger plane shot down by a Soviet fighter jet in September 1983, after the Seoul-bound New York flight flew into USSR airspace during heightened US-Soviet tensions.Russia’s latest attempts at distancing itself from the downing of flight MH17, refuting allegations that it is somehow culpable, could inflame relations with Western leaders.David Cameron had said that if President Putin failed to adjust his stance “radically,” there could be sweeping sanctions imposed on Russia and its business operations abroad.Kiev stresses that its military has not used surface-to-air missiles and it, too, has evidence including video recordings of an anti-aircraft weapon being moved across the country by ""Russian-backed bandits.""Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said its ""Defense Ministry will provide complete information about the whereabouts of all air defense missiles.""In a statement on the Ukrainian government's website, it said it was committed to a ""broad and deep international investigation of the MH17 disaster.""According to Reuters, Ukrainian security forces stand by information it holds that rebels received BUK-M1 missile systems from Russia.Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

1070,U.S. official: Missile shot down Malaysia Airlines plane,"Send iReport your photos and videos.(CNN) -- A Malaysia Airlines passenger jet crashed in a rebel-controlled part of eastern Ukraine on Thursday, spurring swift accusations from Ukrainian officials that ""terrorists"" shot down the aircraft.The United States has concluded a missile shot down the plane, but hasn't pinpointed who was responsible, a senior U.S. official told CNN's Barbara Starr.The Boeing 777 with 298 people aboard fell from the sky near the town of Torez in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, officials said. A top Ukrainian official said the plane, which was on the way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was flying at about 10,000 meters (nearly 33,000 feet) when the missile hit.A radar system saw a surface-to-air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane went down, the senior U.S. official said. A second system saw a heat signature at the time the airliner was hit, the official said. The United States is analyzing the trajectory of the missile to try to learn where the attack came from, the official said.The Obama administration believes Ukraine did not have the capability in the region -- let alone the motivation -- to shoot down the plane, a U.S. official told CNN's Jake Tapper.Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said the plane never made a distress call.He called for an international team to have full access to the crash site.""We must and we will find out precisely what happened to this flight. No stone will be left unturned,"" he said.""If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice,"" Najib said.Ukrainian officials maintained that pro-Russian separatists were behind the crash.Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine's military campaign against the separatists was to blame.""This tragedy would not have happened, if there had been peace on that land, or in any case, if military operations in southeastern Ukraine had not been renewed,"" Putin said in televised remarks. ""And without a doubt the government of the territory on which it happened bears responsibility for this frightening tragedy.""Ukraine's state security chief accused two Russian military intelligence officers of involvement and said they must be punished.Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said he based his allegation on intercepts of phone conversations between the two officers. ""Now you know who carried out this crime. We will do everything for the Russian military who carried out this crime to be punished,"" he told reporters.The jet plunged toward the ground in a fireball, leaving a trail of black smoke behind in the sky.Emergency crews scrambled to what witnesses described as a staggering scene of death and utter destruction.""People said the plane kind of exploded in the air, and that everything rained down in bits and pieces, the plane itself, the people inside,"" said Noah Sneider, an American freelance journalist who interviewed witnesses at the scene.Charred wreckage stretched for kilometers, he said. Stunned rescue workers and rebel fighters combed the area, Sneider said, planting sticks with white cotton ribbons where they found bodies in the fields.""As you walk through the fields, you see a man with his cracked iPhone sticking out of his pocket. You see sort of people's clothing everywhere. Most of it's kind of ripped off by the air. There's some suitcases and stuff in a pile by the road,"" Sneider said.There were many bodies left to be found as night fell, he said, and people were trying to figure out what to do next.Locals in the rural area trying to help were overwhelmed, he said. Firemen who rushed to put out the flames found they had a hose with holes in it, spraying water everywhere, he said.""One man said to me, 'Nothing's happened in this village for 30 years, and now this,'"" Sneider said.As details emerge, accusations flyDetails -- and accusations -- quickly poured in about Thursday's crash, which came the same week that Ukrainian officials said a Russian fighter shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane while the aircraft was in Ukrainian airspace.Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, said in a Facebook post that ""terrorists"" fired on the plane operating a Buk surface-to-air missile system.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko described the crash as a ""terrorist action.""""We do not exclude that the plane was shot down and confirm that the Ukraine Armed Forces did not fire at any targets in the sky,"" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said, according to his website.CNN's Richard Quest, an aviation expert, said that it would be ""extremely unusual"" for an airliner at nearly 33,000 feet to be shot down.From the ground, one could simply look up and tell whether a plane was a commercial aircraft, he said. ""So something is absolutely appalling that's gone on here.""U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said that Ukraine's president had accepted an offer of U.S. experts to help investigate the crash.""They will be on their way rapidly to see if we can get to the bottom of this,"" he said.Biden said the plane was apparently shot down, adding ""not an accident, blown out of the sky.""Who was on the plane?The 15 crew members on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 were all Malaysian nationals, officials said.Malaysia Airlines also gave a breakdown of the known nationalities of the 283 passengers: 154 were Dutch, 27 were Australians, 28 were Malaysians, 12 were Indonesian, nine were from the United Kingdom, four were from Germany; four were from Belgium, three were from the Philippines and one was Canadian. Authorities were still trying to determine the nationalities of the other passengers.The International AIDS Society said in a statement that ""a number of colleagues and friends"" were on the plane, on the way to attend the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia.""At this incredibly sad and sensitive time the IAS stands with our international family and sends condolences to the loved ones of those who have been lost to this tragedy,"" the statement said.Russia-Ukraine disputeThe route the Malaysian plane was on, between Kuala Lumpur and the Netherlands, is a common one, CNN aviation safety consultant Mary Schiavo said Thursday. She said that the plane was flying over a troubled area and that close communication with air traffic controllers would be a key necessity.Torez is in a rebel-held area.In hostile or disputed areas, ""any alteration from your course, and you can have a problem,"" Schiavo said.Tensions have been high between Ukraine and Russia since street protests forced former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych from power in February. Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, and a pro-Russian separatist rebellion has been raging in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.Ukrainian forces have been struggling to quell the separatist unrest. Ukraine's government has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment, including tanks, to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russian separatists.The Pentagon said Wednesday that Russia now has 12,000 troops on the border with Ukraine, as well as some heavy weapons. The troop numbers had fallen to about 1,000 previously from a high of an estimated 40,000 forces earlier this year.READ: Obama imposes new sanctions on Russia over UkraineOn Thursday, CNN reported that Ukrainian officials said a Russian fighter shot down a Ukrainian jet Wednesday as the jet flew in Ukrainian airspace.Tensions are high over that incident, separate from the breaking news of the Malaysian flight Thursday.Three months ago, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying in areas not far from where Flight 17 reportedly crashed Thursday. ""Due to the potential for conflicting air traffic control instructions from Ukrainian and Russian authorities and for the related potential misidentification of civil aircraft, United States flight operations are prohibited until further notice in the airspace over Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov,"" the FAA said in April. Thursday's plane crash reportedly was in eastern Ukraine, scores of miles north-northeast of the Sea of Azov.On Thursday, French transportation official Frederic Cuvillier ordered that French airlines avoid Ukrainian airspace until the cause of Thursday's Malaysia Airlines crash is known, the French Transportation Ministry said in a news release.Airline's troublesThursday's crash marks the second time this year that Malaysia Airlines has faced an incident involving a downed plane.On March 8, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared. That Boeing 777 had 239 people on board. Searchers have found no trace of 370 or its passengers, despite extensive search efforts.Flight 370 probably flew into the southern Indian Ocean on autopilot with an unresponsive crew, Australian authorities said last month.During the early phase of the search for Flight 370, aircraft and ships scoured vast stretches of the surface of the southern Indian Ocean but found no debris.Pings initially thought to be from the missing plane's flight recorders led to a concentrated underwater search that turned up nothing.A new underwater search, farther south, will be broadly in an area where planes and vessels had already looked for debris on the surface of the water. It is expected to begin in August.The first Boeing 777 entered service in June 1995, and the airplane has flown almost five million flights, accumulating more than 18 million flight hours, according to Boeing's web site. The plane is capable to flying up to 43,100 feet.What next? I am shocked by reports that an MH plane crashed. We are launching an immediate investigation.Aviation experts cautioned against jumping to conclusions about Thursday's crash at this early stage.But all agreed that a massive investigation should be launched, involving parties not involved in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia,The families of people on board will demand a transparent international investigation, and so will the global community, Quest said.In the coming days, finding and examining the plane's data recorders will be key -- but the fact that the crash occurred in such a volatile region makes what comes next anything but certain, CNN aviation analyst and pilot Miles O'Brien said.""The big question will be, in whose hands will they fall, and will this be a really objective, international investigation?"" he said.The wreckage path, O'Brien said, will reveal a lot. If a plane breaks up in midair, which is likely what would happen in a missile strike, there would be a large swath of wreckage, he said, but if it breaks down due to mechanical failure, the debris field would be more concentrated.READ: A second lost Boeing 777 for Malaysia AirlinesREAD: Did surface-to-air missile take down MH17?MAPS: The approximate route of MH17 CNN's Jim Sciutto, Dana Ford, Laura Smith-Spark, Mitra Mobasherat and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.",54540990,1103,28296,982,476,887563,"0"

1080,"Malaysia Airlines Passenger Jet Shot Down Over Ukraine, U.S. Officials Say","SectionsTVFeaturedMore from NBC Follow NBC News A Malaysia Airlines jetliner with 298 people on board was shot out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile Thursday as it cruised in a hostile region of Ukraine, U.S. officials told NBC News.The officials said they were trying to determine who fired the missile. The plane went down in one of the most volatile parts of the world — near the Ukrainian border with Russia, where separatists have fought Ukrainian security forces for months.Vice President Joe Biden said at a public appearance that the plane was apparently “shot down, not an accident. Blown out of the sky.”The plane, Malaysia Flight 17, was a Boeing 777. It was about three hours into its journey from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it crashed into a sparse wheat field 31 miles from the Russian border.Photos from the scene showed bodies scattered among the blackened, smoldering wreckage of a jumbo jet.President Barack Obama said the U.S. government was working to determine whether Americans were on board.The crash came four months after another Malaysia Airlines plane, Flight 370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, disappeared with 239 people on board — the greatest mystery in modern aviation.“This is a tragic day in what has already been a tragic year for Malaysia,” Prime Minister Najib Razak said.Flight 17 had 283 passengers, including three infants, and 15 crew on board. There were no reports of survivors. The flight was at about 33,000 feet at last report. Malaysia Airlines said the aircraft had a clean bill of health and a functional communication system at the time of the crash.A Malaysia Airlines official told reporters that 154 Dutch nationals were on the plane. Royal Dutch Airlines said that it had sold some tickets for the flight under what is known as a code-share agreement. Families of those aboard began gathering at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam.The dead include 154 citizens of the Netherlands; 43 from Malaysia, including 15 crew members and two infants; 27 from Australia; 12 from Indonesia, including one infant; nine from the United Kingdom; four each from Germany and Belgium; three from the Philippines; and a citizen of Canada. The nationalities of 41 other victims have not yet been verified.A report by the Russian news agency Interfax said that the crash Thursday was in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, among the most volatile regions in the world. Pro-Russian separatists have been fighting Ukrainian security forces there for months.The U.S. officials said intelligence analysts were still trying to determine whether the missile could have been launched by separatists in Ukraine or by Russian forces across the border.Ukraine claims that separatists have shot down its military planes, including earlier this week. In the early hours after the crash, analysts raised the possibility that someone might have mistaken the civilian jet for another military plane.Andrey Tarasenko, a miner who was walking home from work with a friend, said that he saw a white trail go up from the ground, then heard an explosion two seconds later, then saw smoke risking from the ground 10 seconds after that. He said he was about 10 miles away.“You know how you see a trail from a plane — it was the same, but it was a missile launched from the ground,” he said.Anton Gerashenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on his Facebook page that the plane was hit by a Russian surface-to-air missile known as a Buk. The type of missile can hit a target far higher than Flight 17 was flying.The Associated Press reported earlier this week that it had seen a Buk system on the ground in a separatist-controlled area of eastern Ukraine.The separatists denied responsibility. The separatists were quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax as saying that they had found the “black box” flight recorder. Other Russian reports said the rebels planned to call a three-day cease-fire to allow for an investigation.In the chaotic early hours after the plane went down, the separatists and the Ukrainian government each said the other had shot it down.A Ukrainian interior ministry official said that pro-Russian separatists had downed the plane, and a leader of the separatists, Aleksander Borodai, said that it was the Ukrainian air force.Ukraine’s recently elected president, Petro Poroshenko, called it an act of terrorism. He said he had spoken to the Dutch prime minister and invited the Netherlands to join the investigation.On national television, he said, “I would like to draw your attention that we do not call it an incident, not a disaster, but we call it a terrorist act.”In a video statement, Poroshenko claimed the government had intercepted conversations — one of them allegedly with a Russian colonel whom he identified as Vasiliy Geranin — in which rebel commanders and fighters were ""boasting about the hit airplane."" NBC News couldn't authenticate the recordings, which the Ukrainian government posted online.At a government meeting in Moscow late Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to pin the blame on Ukraine, saying ""the state over whose territory this happened bears the responsibility for the terrible tragedy.""""This tragedy would not have happened had there been peace in this land, if hostilities had not resumed in the southeast of Ukraine,"" Putin was quoted as saying by Interfax.The site of a Malaysia Airlines plane crash in the settlement of Grabovo in Donetsk region: http://t.co/yVWeqntSaK pic.twitter.com/guBJ5ppeRyImages appearing to depict the crash site spread quickly on social media.

The defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said that there was no confirmation that the plane had been shot down. He said on Twitter that the Malaysian military had been instructed to “get on it.”Obama spoke on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that Putin noted the reports of a downed passenger jet. Officials at the Pentagon scrambled to learn more and assess who might have had the capability to shoot down an airliner.The conflict in Ukraine has raised tensions between Russia and the West to their highest since the end of the Cold War.In February, protesters toppled the pro-Russian government in Kiev, and Russia answered by invading and later annexing the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine. Since then, pro-Russian separatists have fought Ukrainian security forces in the east.Evan Kohlmann, an NBC News terrorism analyst, said that shooting down a 777 at 33,000 feet would require “access to serious military equipment.”“The chances this was done by a conventional terrorist group like al Qaeda or something like that is almost nonexistent,” he said.The immediate impact on relations between Russia and the West was not clear. At the request of Ukraine, Britain asked for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council, a U.N. diplomat told NBC News.Data from the website FlightAware showed that Flight 17 took off from Amsterdam at about 6:30 a.m. ET. Its last recorded position was over Ukraine, west of the Russian border, at 9:19 a.m. ET.Delta Air Lines, the German airline Lufthansa and two Russian airlines said that they would stop flying over the region. Lufthansa said that it would use a “wide detour,” and that four of its flights Thursday were affected by that change.American Airlines said that it does not fly over Ukraine. American commercial airliners have been prohibited from flying over some parts of Ukraine since April, after Russian President Vladimir Putin moved to annex Crimea, but the crash site Thursday was outside that zone.Boeing said it was trying to learn more and that its thoughts and prayers were with everyone on board, their families and loved ones.The Boeing 777 had one of the best safety records in the industry. No one was killed aboard that model until in July 2013, when a 777 operated by Asiana Airlines crash-landed in San Francisco, resulting in three deaths. Flight 370, which was also a 777, disappeared March 8.Alexander Smith, Courtney Kube, Alastair Jamieson, Catherine Chomiak.

There were reportedly no Russian citizens aboard the flight. Gerashchenko said on his Facebook page that the rebels used a Buk anti-aircraft system to shoot down the plane, which was flying at about 32,000 feet.A Buk anti-aircraft system is a sophisticated surface-to-air missile that rebels in eastern Ukraine acquired in June, according to Itar-Tass.

Photo by NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute; NASA,ESA, and M. Buie (Southwest Research Institute); NASA; Phil PlaitThe very first nonsense I had to debunk in 2014 was a claim that on Jan. 4 of that year a planetary alignment would cause gravity to decrease, allowing you to float momentarily or fall more slowly if you jumped in the air at the right moment: “Zero G Day.” This exact same hoax has resurfaced this week in a couple of places, so I’ve decided to update the debunking to include some new links and repost it, hopefully to stem the tide of silliness at year’s end. It seems fitting that (hopefully) this is also the last debunking I’ll make in 2014. But who knows? There’s still a week left.Something you’ll never hear me say: “Well, now I’ve heard it all.”Long experience has taught me there is always a sillier claim. Always. And you’re hearing that from a guy who has debunked the ideas that the Maya calendar predicted the end of the world, that the “Supermoon” caused earthquakes, and that a magnetic pole flip of the Earth will cause superstorms (and another saying the Earth is already physically starting to flip over).So what’s sillier than these? Well, we now have the claim that early next year—on Jan. 4, 2015 at 09:47 PST to be exact—due to the combined gravity of Jupiter and Pluto, you will be able to jump in the air and float for just a couple of seconds (or at least fall more slowly, depending on different “sources”).It’s hard for me to overstate just how wrong this claim is. First off, this exact same hoax was pulled last year, in 2014, by a site called News Hound (now offline, apparently), and a lot of people fell for it. Here we are again, a year later, back at the same spot. This time the joke is being made by a “news” site called Daily Buzz Live (which didn’t even bother to change much of the wording of the original hoax). They even have a picture of a NASA tweet about the event:Photo from Daily Buzz LiveThere’s only one problem: That picture is completely fake. NASA never tweeted it, and it was presumably made up wholesale for the article on Daily Buzz Live. Whoever did it was clever, adding the number of retweets and favorites, but it’s as fake as a $20 iPhone you can buy on the street in New York City.After all, the physics of “Zero G Day” is wrong, the claim about Pluto and Jupiter is wrong, and—and this part is the real killer—it’s based on a joke made by an astronomer nearly 40 years ago!Despite this, it’s spreading around Facebook (and Twitter) so much once again that I got a lot of people asking or telling me about it. That’s why I’m debunking this thing again.So to get started, here’s the claim:It has been revealed by the British astronomer Patrick Moore that, on the morning of January 4th 2014, an extraordinary astronomical event will occur. At exactly 9:47 am, the planet Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to the Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people weigh less. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.Yeah, except this is all baloney. To be polite. OK, so why is this wrong?Pluto and Jupiter, Sitting in a Tree …First of all, the gravitational forces of the other planets in the solar system have essentially zero effect on you personally.And we’re done. Full stop.OK, fine, I’ll give some brief details. The planets are big objects with lots of gravity, but that only affects you if you’re close to them. Space, however, is big—that’s why we call it space—and planets are far away. This weakens their gravity on you hugely, reducing it to less than the impact of the flutter of a butterfly’s wing.Photo by Shutterstock/Jaimie DuplassIf you want the math, then here you go: Even if you add all of the planets together, they pull on you with a force less than 2 percent of that of the Moon! The Daily Buzz Live article mentions tides, too, but that’s even worse: The combined tidal force from the planets is far less, like 0.005 percent of the Moon’s! Simply put, the planets are just too far away to have any real effect on you. By the way, the Moon orbits the Earth on an ellipse, so its own gravity fluctuates far more than the combined strength of the planets every two weeks.Note that you cannot float in the air every two weeks.And specifically, the gravity from Pluto is weakest of them all. Pluto is a teeny tiny ice ball, far smaller than even our Moon … and at its closest it’s flippin’ 4 billion kilometers (2.5 billion miles) from Earth. That’s a long way. A car on the road half a kilometer away has more gravitational pull on you than Pluto does.In fact, doing the math, I find that the Earth pulls on you about 200 trillion times harder than Pluto does. That’s about the same ratio as the number of cells in your body to a single cell … so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your arms.Location3It gets worse (amazingly). The article says Pluto will be “directly behind Jupiter” on Jan. 4, 2015. I checked: On that day they are on nearly opposite sides of the sky. They’re really far apart, about 145°. You couldn’t have picked a much worse date to claim Pluto was behind Jupiter.So the physics of the claim is ridiculous. But the origin of the claims makes it even funnier.Photo by Shutterstock/simekeshFool Me Once, Shame on YouThe article on Daily Buzz Live mentions that this claim came from Patrick Moore. He was a real astronomer in the U.K., an enormously popular radio and television science program presenter—he predated Carl Sagan and is still considered an icon of science in England.The wonderful thing about all this is: Moore actually did make this claim! However, as Snopes.com points out, it was an April Fools’ Day joke. Moore made this claim in 1976 on his radio program. To my complete unsurprise, apparently some folks called in to say they did feel the effect! This is called “priming,” where you tell people in advance that they’ll feel something due to some cause, and they will, even if the cause never happened. It’s used by ghost hunters and ghost tour guides quite a bit, to spook people before they actually enter a “haunted house,” guaranteeing they’ll feel chills as they walk from room to room. I’ve seen this myself first hand: People can convince themselves of amazing things that never actually happened.Hope FloatsSo there you go: It’s a repeat of a silly claim based on a joke in the first place.I know a lot of people reading this right now are slapping their foreheads and wondering how people can be so stupid as to fall for this. I understand this reaction, but I don’t share it. Smart people fall for silly things all the time, and intelligence isn’t really the prime factor here.Photo by Shutterstock/Glenn PriceSkepticism is. In general, schools don’t teach people how to analyze a claim, how to tell if something makes sense on the surface of it, or how to go about looking into the claim. I knew right away to do the math, and to see if Pluto and Jupiter really were aligned as the article says. But all too often, people don’t think carefully (or at all) about these claims, and simply spread them through social media. All it takes is literally the click of a “Share” button. Pseudoscience thrives via this virulence, whereas truth must take a harder path.In fact, that’s why I bother debunking stuff like this. Sure, this is a silly claim, and probably harmless in practice. But not all of them are; I already mentioned the “Mayan Notpocalypse” from 2012, and I can tick off a dozen other doomsday or scary claims that spread due to a lack of skepticism. And of course there are real issues like global warming denial, anti-vaccination, and more, which live and breathe and spread due to a lack of skepticism in the public.In my original post about this in January 2014, I said, “This particular bit of fluff will dry up and float away in a day or two, but those others are here to stay for a long time.” I was wrong, and I should’ve known that something like this would resurface again in a year; it’s like the “Mars as big as the Moon” nonsense that comes back year after year.Still, my hope is that every time we take a moment to inject a bit of (polite) skepticism into people’s everyday lives, it makes the world a slightly better place to be.If enough of us do it often enough, we can change “slightly” to “magnificently.”Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.All contents © 2021 The Slate Group LLC.

        ABC Reportedly Paid Darren Wilson Six-Figure Fee for Interview
    ","ABC offered Darren Wilson a “mid-to-high” six-figure payment to give his first and only public interview on the network, according to the website Got News. An unnamed source from NBC reportedly told the website that both networks engaged in a bidding war to score the first interview with Wilson but NBC backed out after its rival “upped the ante.”The interview was taped in an undisclosed location and broadcast Tuesday, the day after a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson for the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The grand jury’s decision set off protests and riots in Ferguson and many other U.S. cities. Demonstrators called for justice in the killing of Brown and criticized the police and prosecutors for how they investigated and tried the case.During the interview, which was conducted by ABC host George Stephanopoulos, Wilson gave his account of the events that took place before he killed Brown. Most of what Wilson told ABC was already covered in his testimony before the grand jury. When asked by Stephanopoulos if there was anything he could have done differently, Wilson said “No.”ABC and Stephanopoulos have been criticized for not challenging Wilson’s account of the incident. People took to Twitter to express their dislike of the interview.So do we. The past year has been the most arduous of our lives. The Covid-19 pandemic continues to be catastrophic not only to our health - mental and physical - but also to the stability of millions of people.

Fox Falls For Fake Story About Obama Personally Funding Muslim Museum During Shutdown

","Written by Mike Burns

ShareComment
Fox & Friends Saturday criticized President Obama for offering to personally pay for a “museum of Muslim culture” during the government shutdown, a claim that originated from a satire website.On October 5, the co-hosts of Fox & Friends Saturday discussed the closure of the World War II Memorial, which resulted from the Republican-led shutdown. During the discussion, co-host Anna Kooiman claimed that while the memorial is closed, “President Obama has offered to pay out of his own pocket for the museum of Muslim culture.”KOOIMAN: The Republican National Committee is offering to pay for it to keep it open so that the veterans from Honor Flight are going to be able to go and see this because who did it honor? It honored them. It really doesn't seem fair, especially -- and we're going to talk a little bit later in the show too about some things that are continuing to be funded. And President Obama has offered to pay out of his own pocket for the museum of Muslim culture out of his own pocket, yet it's the Republican National Committee who's paying for this. Unfortunately for Kooiman, the claim that Obama offered to pay out of pocket for a “museum of Muslim culture” originated from the satirical website the National Report. As the fact-checking site Snopes.com points out, a now-removed disclaimer on the National Report noted: “National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news.”Fox has a history of passing off satirical stories as actual news. UPDATE: On October 6, Kooiman issued the following statement via Twitter: “Just met w producers- I made a mistake yday after receiving flawed research abt a museum possibly closing. My apologies. Won't happen again.”UPDATE 2: The Associated Press reported that, according to a spokeswoman, Fox will issue an on-air correction Saturday, October 12:Fox will correct the mistake on the air this Saturday, spokeswoman Dana Klinghoffer said. Fox's policy is to correct mistakes on the same show where they are made.UPDATE 3: Kooiman issued an on-air correction during the October 12 broadcast of Fox & Friends Saturday, apologizing for making a “bad mistake” reporting a story that was “not true”:I wanted to get to this this morning -- last weekend we mentioned a story about the president funding a Muslim museum during the shutdown. We made a bad mistake by reporting a story based on poor research that was not true. We apologize for not checking the facts and for allowing the story to make air.

1143,Report: NHL expansion to Vegas ‘a done deal’,"NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. Aaron Vincent Elkaim/CPNHL commissioner Gary Bettman has said publicly that expansion isn’t something the league has seriously considered, but a recent report says otherwise.According to The Vancouver Province’s Tony Gallagher, an expansion team in Las Vegas is “a done deal.” “Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.”With a team in Las Vegas “all but assured,” Gallagher also implies that talk of a Seattle expansion isn’t without merit as many potential owners – including Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman – have shown plenty of interest. The biggest obstacle facing Seattle is the lack of an NHL-calibre arena, as Bettman explained on Sportsnet 590 The Fan in June is that “the building situation is very unsettled and frankly if there was no reasonable prospect of a building coming anytime soon.”The addition of two teams in the Western Conference would pull it even with the 16-team Eastern Conference. However, Gallagher indicates the NHL could expand beyond only two teams, mentioning Quebec City and Kansas City.To see your localized preferences, please enable geolocation services in your browser settings.NoneNoneWould you like to create an account so you can see these Favourites on your other devices too?Customize your Sportsnet lineup for the latest news from your favourite leagues and teams.Customize your lineup with your favourite leagues and teams.There isn’t enough recent news in your lineup.

A 21-year-old Florida woman says she spent $20,000 for a third breast to make herself ""unattractive to men."" The admittedly ""crazy"" massage therapist, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, told an Orlando radio station in a bizarre interview that she had the plastic surgery because she doesn't want to date anymore. ""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show last week. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy."" She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station. Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV. When asked about her new addition, she told ""The News Junkie"" that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones."" Many people believe that Tridevil's claim is a hoax, since she has not provided any real proof. Skeptics say the pics of her with the third breast are Photoshopped. ""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" she told 10 News in Tampa. However, when the TV station asked for some verification, she gave the camera just ""a quick flash,"" according to the report. She wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show,"" she told the station. Her parents, though, apparently took her seriously. ""I told my mom on camera,"" she told the station. ""(She) ran out the door."" dboroff@nydailynews.com USING MOBILE? CLICK FOR VIDEO",803689,830,6997,1106,1615,252681,"0"

Courtesy Security Service of Ukraine/YouTubeDebris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 is shown smouldering in a field July 17, 2014 in Grabovo, Ukraine near the Russian border.Source:Getty ImagesTHE Russian government has allegedly been busted editing a Wikipedia entry on the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 disaster to blame Ukraine. A Twitter bot which monitors edits made on the site by Russian government IP addresses picked up the changes which were made on a page listing civil aviation accidents, the UK’s  Telegraph reported.The original entry stated that the plane was shot down “by terrorists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic with Buk system missiles, which the terrorists received from the Russian Federation”.It was changed to read: “the plane [flight MH17] was shot down by Ukrainian soldiers”.The Twitter bot issued this alert:Статья в Википедии Список авиационных катастроф в гражданской авиации была отредактирована ВГТРК http://t.co/peZ60q07FjIt translates to: “Wikipedia article List of aircraft accidents in civil aviation has been edited by RTR [another name for VGTRK]”.‘Security zone’ agreed uponUkraine and pro-Russian rebels have agreed to set up a security zone around the crash site, Ukraine’s security service chief said.Internationally mediated talks “concluded with an agreement to set up a 20-kilometre security zone so that Ukraine could fulfil the most important thing — identify the bodies (and) hand them over to relatives,” Ukrainian Security Service head Valentyn Nalyvaychenko said in televised remarks.‘Justice for the dead and living’Prime Minister Tony Abbott has told of the difficulty of investigations into the downed MH17 flight, saying it will be weeks before there are answers for the victims’ families.He said Australian officials have been deployed to the region.“Yesterday we saw the smouldering wreckage on our screens, today we have seen some of the faces of the dead,” he said.“As a nation we need to prepare ourselves for difficult and painful weeks ahead as we strive to find out precisely what has happened and who is responsible.“My aim is to get justice for Australia, in particular to get justice for the dead and the living. The only way to get justice is if there is a thorough investigation and that means getting access to the site as swiftly as possible ... it’s imperative that the site is made available to investigators without molestation and hindrance as fast as possible.”Abbott said the area is controlled by rebels and “bodies remain strewn over the fields of Eastern Ukraine”.He emphasised just how dangerous the situation is.“Overnight, a monitoring mission from the organisation for the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe did gain temporary access but it was driven off by gunfire presumably from the Russian-backed rebels.“This does highlight though the difficulty and danger of this mission.”Attempts to contact the Russian government have been unsuccessful so far.The Ukraine government had said it would give Australia all the support it needed to access the site to retrieve bodies and protect evidence.Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will be heading to the US to champion Australia’s campaign at the UN Security Council for an independent comprehensive international investigation with access to the site, debris, black box and any possible witnesses.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have deployed six officers to Kiev and more are on their way, including a five-member emergency response team. Australian Federal Police investigators are also on their way, and more are ready to be deployed as the situation develops.Contingency arrangements have been put in place to repatriate the bodies, he added.“Although I must caution this is likely to be weeks, rather than days ahead.”Ms Bishop noted that for the investigation to proceed, a cease fire around the crash site would be required.Qantas and Virgin have offered their support for any Australians travelling to the site.Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.Source:Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the Government doesn’t want the MH17 disaster to distract from its G20 agenda despite growing pressure for Australia to bar Russia from attending the forum later this year.The downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 has overshadowed the opening of the G20 trade ministers meeting in Sydney on Saturday, where top officials from the world’s 20 richest nations including Russia have gathered to discuss economic growth.Treasurer Joe Hockey said there was a “steely determination” to find out who was responsible for the disaster but also not to allow it to distract from the task facing G20 ministers.“There’s no doubt the events are tragic, just tragic,” Mr Hockey said in Sydney ahead of the G20 meeting.“But we have to move on with the world, bring those people to justice that were responsible for that horrendous act, but also not allow it to distract us from the challenge of creating a world that has greater prosperity and freedom.”Nearly 300 people — including 28 Australians — were killed when MH17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine near the Russian border. Suspicion has fallen on Russian-backed rebels, prompting calls for Moscow to be punished with trade sanctions.Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who met with his Russian counterpart Alexey Ulyukaev ahead of chairing the G20 meeting, didn’t rule out the prospect of trade sanctions if Russia didn’t play ball.“These are things we need to consider in the goodness of time,” Mr Robb said.“It is a matter of how Russia responds, co-operates and is proactive in seeking answers.”Malaysian prime minister’s griefThe step-grandmother of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was on board MH17, the country’s defence minister confirmed.Hishammuddin Hussein, a cousin of Najib’s, said 83-year-old Siti Amirah was “on the flight”. Siti Amirah was also Hishammuddin’s step-grandmother.“Pls pray 4 her,” he wrote on his Twitter feed above a photo of her in an Islamic headscarf.#MH17 my step grandmother was on the flight . Pls pray 4 her . pic.twitter.com/vIyYXOqWbCThe defence minister’s tweet today confirmed an earlier report in the Star newspaper that said Siti Amirah had embarked alone in Amsterdam on board flight MH17 en route to the Indonesian city of Jogjakarta.She was scheduled to transit at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.Bizarre account A top pro-Russia rebel commander in eastern Ukraine has given a bizarre version of events surrounding the Malaysian jetliner crash - suggesting many of the victims may have died days before the plane took off.The pro-rebel website Russkaya Vesna quoted Igor Girkin as saying he was told by people at the crash site that “a significant number of the bodies weren’t fresh,” adding that he was told they were drained of blood and reeked of decomposition.Air travel warningPilots and aircraft operators are being warned by the Australian aviation regulator to avoid flying over eastern Ukraine, following similar advice from US and European air safety agencies.No Australian planes are presently scheduled to fly above eastern Ukraine where MH17 was shot down by a suspected surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people on board.“Australian air operators and pilots considering operations in eastern European airspace (should) take into account all available safety notices and bulletins regarding flights in the Ukraine region,” the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) said.“Particular attention should be given to notices issued by the United States Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency.” US aircraft have been prohibited by the country’s Federal Aviation Administration from flying above parts of eastern Ukraine. “The restricted area includes the entire Simferopol and Dnepropetrovsk ... regions,” the FAA said.“This action expands a prohibition of US flight operations issued by the FAA in April, over the Crimean region of Ukraine and adjacent areas of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.”First photo of pilotDetails of the pilots of downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 have been revealed.The plane with 298 people on board, including at least 28 Australians, was downed about 12.15am Sydney time yesterday.The flight MH17, a Boeing 777-200, was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur but was shot down in separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine.The two captains on the plane were Eugene Choo Jin Leong, 45, and Wan Amran Wan Hussin, 50, according to a list.A photograph of Leong shows him alongside a motorbike. A family member of Leong’s, who did not want to be named, confirmed that he was on board the plane. Meanwhile, Captain Wan Amran Wan Hussin’s wife reportedly told the  New Straits Times that he had contacted her minutes before he boarded the flight.The mother-of-two was shocked to learn what had happened when she randomly checked her phone.“I had just finished my prayers and decided to checked my handphone as the battery had earlier gone flat.“I was shocked to see a message from my children’s ustaz (religious teacher) informing me that a Malaysia Airlines plane had crashed.“I was taken aback and immediately switched on the television to see what was going on.”Pilot: Eugene Choo Jin Leong was flying Malaysia airlines MH17 when it was shot downSource:SuppliedNationalities of victimsMalaysia Airlines has released a new list of the nationalities of passengers who lost their lives on MH17.

Mr Shorten said the Australian government should consider barring Mr Putin from the upcoming G20 meeting in Brisbane if the country did not support the investigation.“If the Russian Federation will not co-operate to help resolve and get to the heart of what has happened here, I don’t think Australians would welcome them coming to the G20,” he said.Opposition Leader Bill Shorten.Source:News Corp AustraliaRoyal condolencesPrince William has expressed his sympathy for all those affected by the disaster, noting in particular the impact on Australians.Speaking at Australia House in London, the Duke of Cambridge spoke of his great sadness.“For all of us who have lost fellow countrymen and women in the tragedy, words cannot do justice to our sense of loss,” he said. “For Australians, for our Malaysian brothers and sisters in the Commonwealth, the crash is a particularly cruel tragedy, coming so soon after the loss of MH370.” He said his family’s thoughts and prayers were with everyone affected.The Duke was at Australia House to unveil a statue of Matthew Flinders, the first explorer to circumnavigate Australia.Australian High Commissioner to London Alexander Downer also spoke about the tragedy, asking for a moment’s silence for those killed.Britain's Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and his brother Prince Harry.Source:AFPObama speaks outUS President Barack Obama has sent his condolences to the families of victims.

If, as Russia claims, Ukraine is responsible for this, I expect Russia to support a thorough investigation”, she said.Ms Bishop’s words were backed by the UN Security Council, which passed a unanimous motion calling for a full and thorough investigation.“The members of the Security Council called for a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the incident in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines and for appropriate accountability,” the council said in a unanimous declaration.The UN statement expressed the council’s “deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims, and to the people and governments of all those killed in the crash.”Council members stood in a moment of silent tribute to the 298 victims at the start of an emergency council meeting. The council called for an investigation “in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines and for appropriate accountability.”It stressed the need for “immediate access by investigators to the crash site to determine the cause of the incident.”Ms Bishop also said she had been unable to get in touch with her Russian counterpart, who is on holidays, and was told by the Russians she could not speak to a more junior representative.The comments came after Prime Minister Tony Abbott earlier condemned the initial response of the Russian Ambassador to the MH17 disaster.Julie Bishop following her meeting with the Russian Ambassador Vladimir Morozov.Source:AFPMr Abbott said it was “highly probable” MH17 was “shot down” by what appeared to be a Russian-backed rebel missile.Yesterday afternoon, the Prime Minister revealed the first response from the Russian Ambassador was to blame Ukraine forces for the tragedy — a response he called “deeply, deeply unsatisfactory”.The ambassador had been summoned to speak in Sydney with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who was seeking assurances Russia would co-operate with investigators and Australia would get access to the crash site.Mr Abbott repeated his statement made in Parliament that the disaster was a crime and not an accident.Rescue crews walk through the crash site.Source:APAustralia was working for a binding UN Security Council resolution to secure an independent international investigation, he said.“It’s very important that we don’t allow Russia to prevent an absolutely comprehensive investigation.”Mr Abbott said Australia was eager to take a leading role in the investigation, given the high number of Australians killed.“These people were innocent people going about their lives ... And they have been killed by Russian-backed rebels ... Possibly with Russian supplied missiles.”He had strong words for those that supplied the rebels with the missile.“Anyone who gave such a weapon to people who were absolutely incapable of using it ... Should feel a sense of shame.”He said Russia’s involvement would be a test for that country. “There can be no excuses, no buck passing.”Mr Abbott said there would be a national day of mourning and ordered flags at government buildings to be flown at half-mast tomorrow.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said anyone with concerns for friends or family can call the hotline on 1300 555 135.People search for bodies near the wreckage of Flight MH17Source:AFPTHE VICTIMSMalaysia Airlines says there were 298 people on board, not 295 as originally stated.

Who had the equipment? It’s obviously an anti-aircraft missile. Who could have had the expertise to do that? Because commercial airlines are big targets, but by the time they got over that part of Ukraine they should have been high, so it takes some planning [to target such a plane].“And the Ukrainian government has been quick to blame it on terrorists, which is their name for the Russian insurgents.

The region where MH17 went down has seen severe fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists in recent days. Ukraine has been in crisis ever since pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was driven from office in February by a protest movement among citizens wanting closer ties with the European Union. Russia later annexed the Crimean Peninsula in southern Ukraine, and pro-Russians separatists in the country’s eastern regions began occupying government buildings and pressing for independence.

Swedish Man 'Dies After Having Sex With Hornet's Nest'","Stung by the Hornet's Nest: Hasse Sex-with-Insects Tale a HoaxMan Has Sex With Hornet's Nest: Top Five Hoax News Stories
The bizarre story of a man who died after trying to have sex with a hornet's nest has been exposed as a hoax.The tale of the man known as 'Hasse' said to have been found dead with 146 sting marks on his body, including 54 to his genitals, was first published by News Sweden.His body was found by a neighbour in the town of Ystad, who, according the spoof online publication, said Hasse was so swollen he initially mistook him for a whale carcass.Hasse was unconscious when he was found but died an hour later from the injuries he sustained, claimed the story - which was never officially verified.A London newspaper took up the story claiming a neighbour Bertil Ståhfrääs (who's name transalates as 'erection' in Swdish) said: ""At first [I thought he was lying there by] of choice, so I called 'Hasse' to ask what the hell he was doing.""I walked up to the body and then I recognised his tattoo on his neck.""I have never in my life seen such a swollen pelvic bone. It hid the whole package [and] the scrotum was enlarged. Right now it feels heavy and unreal. We did not talk very often, but he was still my neighbour.""A supposed autopsy of Hasse's body allegedly showed semen on some of the dead wasps and a number of the victim's pubic hair was found at the entrance of the nest. His fingerprints were also found on the nest, leading the police to believe he had been trying to have sex with the hornet's nest when he was stung to death.""To attempt to have intercourse with a hornet's nest is a very bad idea,"" Siv Underlivh, a psychologist and expert on sex fantasies told the news website. Underlivh was also a play on words, meaning 'fetish' in Swedish.""I don't even think about the pain he must have suffered both within himself [from his fetish] and incurred by the wasp attack.""Hornet stings are more painful than typical wasp stings because of their venom. They can also sting multiple times.The stings are not normally fatal to humans unless a person is allergic to their venom, in which case they can go into anaphylactic shock.",12476148,48488,23552,793,680,36238,"0"
1225,Oregon Community Donates Minivan So Boy Won’t Be Late to School Anymore,"They wanted to help after a photo of the boy punished for being late went viral.Community Helps Little Boy Arrive to School on Time— -- When a photo of a boy being punished at lunch for being late to school went viral, an Oregon community got together to make sure that didn’t happen again.Hunter Cmelo and his family have a new minivan thanks to the local businesses in Medford, Oregon, and Grants Pass, Oregon, and a local radio host who heard his story.The 6-year-old arrived late to Lincoln Elementary School last week because his family was having car trouble.“[The school has] a policy where every three tardies, you get a detention,” Hunter’s mother, Nicole Garloff, 25, of Grants Pass, told ABC News. “Every tardy after that, you get a detention.”Garloff said they knew Hunter would be getting a detention that day and that he was crying when he went in that morning. But she was shocked when she visited him at lunch that day and learned what his detention was actually like.“He was at the first table as you walk into the cafeteria, and he was just sitting there with one of those cardboard poster partitions in front of him ... and two or three books next to him,” Garloff said.She said the school policy was to have students make up work they missed because they were late. Since Hunter was only late by a few minutes, he didn’t have work to make up, so he was told to read a book.“I was really upset. I went and got my iPad and took a picture of him,” said Garloff. “He wasn’t tardy so many times that he deserved that.After Garloff posted the photo on her Facebook, the image of her son sitting alone at lunch went viral, coming to the attention of AM 1440 radio personality Bill Meyer. Meyer first heard about the story through his listeners and social media.“We see a lot of bad news, or we have a lot of problems. So seldomly do we ever get a chance to fix the root of the problem,” Meyer told ABC News. “I saw the school policy as being unjust, but I saw the root of the trouble was car trouble.”So Meyer reached out to Lisa McClease-Kelly, who owns Kelly’s Automotive, which is located in Medford and in Grants Pass, to see if she would be willing to repair the family’s Dodge Durango.“The repairs were more than what the car was actually worth,” McClease-Kelly told ABC News. Luckily, a local company, Rapid Repo and Collections, offered to donate a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country van to the family.Other local businesses pitched in to install a new windshield in the van, two new tires, and McClease-Kelly put about $1,400 of maintenance into it. Hunter’s family was surprised when they came to the shop this week.“We thought we were going there to be told that our Durango was not going to be fixable at all,” Garloff said. “We were so shocked, it doesn’t seem real. I’m trying to tell Hunter that this doesn’t just happen to you.”McClease-Kelly will give the family free oil changes for a year, and many others who heard their story donated to give the family a gas card, as well as gift cards to local restaurants.“This family never asked for the help. All they ever wanted was to change the school policy,” Meyer said. “We saw a way to do a little nudge, and then everyone else came in with their time and generosity.”The school policy has since been amended, according to the Grants Pass District Superintendent’s office.“As a result of the concerns raised, the district ended the learning catch-up location at Lincoln Elementary School,” the Grants Pass District said in a statement. “Going forward, a separate, supervised classroom has been designated for necessary catch-up work.”Garloff said Hunter hasn’t been late since the family got the van and that she is waiting to see if the school’s policy will change.“We’re so thankful to all the people in our community that have just been so supportive,” Garloff said.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",16799853,507,122931,1262,107,3164,"1"

1228,Another Killing in Ferguson Leaves a Family Grappling With the Unknown ,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Jack HealyFERGUSON, Mo. — Just up the road from the memorial of stuffed animals and candles that has become a place of pilgrimage and protest over the shooting death of Michael Brown, there is an empty parking lot where another young black man was killed last week on the night this city erupted in rage.There are no rallies or news cameras there, no signs or ribbons to mark the spot where, the police say, Deandre Joshua, 20, was shot once in the head and then set on fire inside his car. He was the only person killed during the fires, looting and riots that shook the city after a grand jury declined to indict a white police officer in Mr. Brown’s killing. But in the days since, Mr. Joshua’s death has largely become a footnote to Ferguson’s story — an open homicide case and a bitter mystery for his family.“The unknown is what scares me,” his mother, Maria, 39, said in an interview at her home in nearby University City, where her son and his identical twin brother, Dont’A (Don-TAY), shared the basement. “I don’t know what happened to him.”The police have offered few details about the killing. Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police suggested last week that there could be “a nexus” between the broader unrest and Mr. Joshua’s death, but a police spokesman said it remained unclear whether there was any direct link. The police have not named any suspects, and have said it was unclear precisely when Mr. Joshua was killed or why his body was burned.Last Tuesday, the morning after the riots, Ms. Joshua was watching the news, she said, when she saw reports of a body found inside a white Pontiac Grand Prix near the Canfield Green Apartments, in the neighborhood where Mr. Brown had been killed. The news cameras focused in to reveal a crack in the car’s bumper and a missing front license plate. And Ms. Joshua said: “I knew it was him. It was him.”She and Dont’A rushed to the scene.His mother and brother described Mr. Joshua as a young man who liked to joke, worked nights stocking shelves at Walmart and dreamed of becoming a rapper. He graduated from Jennings Senior High School in 2012, according to Tiffany Anderson, the district superintendent.He lived with his mother, brother and two younger sisters, and was still trying to figure out his way in the world, his family said. He considered joining the Army or applying to community college, but let both options slide.His family said Mr. Joshua had never joined the marches and protests over Mr. Brown’s shooting, even though, in a twist of fate, the twin brothers were childhood friends with a crucial figure in the case, the witness who was walking with Mr. Brown when he was killed.“It was just something that happened,” Dont’A Joshua said of the Brown shooting.The area where Mr. Joshua and Mr. Brown died is one of the more violent corners of Ferguson, accounting for 18 percent of all serious crimes reported from 2010 to August 2012, according to an analysis of crime statistics by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Mr. Joshua never told his family that he felt threatened there, and he did not seem to have any enemies, his mother and brother said. But as Ferguson grew tense as the grand jury prepared to decide the fate of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Mr. Brown, Ms. Joshua worried about Deandre, she said.“I kept calling him that day, to tell him to be careful with this Ferguson riots,” she said. “And I never got an answer. I couldn’t get an answer.”That night, Ms. Joshua said, Deandre watched the grand jury announcement with his aunt and two cousins on Winkler Drive, about a mile east of where his body was found. He was happy because Walmart had canceled his shift in anticipation of unrest.Around 2 a.m., as a dozen buildings along West Florissant Avenue were burning and gunshots were crackling through the city, Ms. Joshua said, her son left his aunt’s home to make the short drive to the apartment of a girl he had been seeing for about a month. It is unclear how he ended up in the nearby parking lot of the Northwinds Apartments.His death became fodder for online speculation, caught in the fervor over the unrest in Ferguson. People sifting through thousands of pages of redacted grand jury testimony from the Brown case posited that Mr. Joshua was one of the unnamed witnesses.But Mr. Joshua’s family said he had known nothing about Mr. Brown’s death and never testified before the grand jury. A former girlfriend, Chasity Jones, a student at Southern Illinois University, said she and Mr. Joshua were at a St. Louis-area beauty salon in August when they heard news of Mr. Brown’s death.Missouri court records show that Deandre Joshua was arrested once, on a misdemeanor charge of resisting arrest, in April 2013, and had completed his sentence of community service and a year’s probation. A full record of the incident was not immediately available from the St. Louis County Police.As it waits for answers, his family has started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to cover his funeral and burial. The family scans the online speculation about him, but tries to look beyond it. And Ms. Joshua said she found herself driving past that ordinary-looking parking lot.“I don’t know why I go there — I just ride by,” she said. “That was the last place he was at.”Advertisement",16261,3522,415464,1041,295,8901,"0"

1282,"43 Missing Students, a Mass Grave and a Suspect: Mexico’s Police","AdvertisementSupported byBy Randal C. ArchiboldIGUALA, Mexico — They were farm boys who did well in school and took one of the few options available beyond the backbreaking work in the corn and bean fields of southern Mexico: enrolling in a local teachers college with a history of radicalism but the promise of a stable classroom job.Leonel Castro, 19, the oldest of seven siblings, vowed to use his salary to help his impoverished family. Júlio César, 19, thought he could run a school one day and ensure the best for the next generation. Adán Abraham de la Cruz, 23, wanted to put his computer skills to good use in the classroom.“He was just preparing himself to get ahead like any young person would do,” said Mr. de la Cruz’s father, Bernabé.Now, they are among 43 students reported missing after deadly clashes with the police on Sept. 26, when at least six student protesters and bystanders were killed in the restive, rural state of Guerrero, one of the poorest in the country and long afflicted by political, social and criminal upheaval.The state prosecutor investigating why the police opened fire on students from their vehicles has found mass graves in Iguala — the small industrial city where the confrontations occurred — containing 28 badly burned and dismembered bodies.The prosecutors had already arrested 22 police officers after the clashes, saying the officers secretly worked for, or were members of, a local gang. Now they are investigating whether the police apprehended the students after the confrontation and deliberately turned them over to the local gang. Two witnesses in custody told prosecutors that the gang then killed the protesters on the orders of a leader known as El Chucky.“I saw police trucks go up and down the hill to up there, where the bodies are found,” said one man in the neighborhood near the site who declined to give his name out of fear. “Then came the news they found the grave and it may be the students. But you would be a fool around here to accuse the police and expect to live.”Even in a country accustomed to mass killings, the case has generated alarm, both for the possible involvement of the police and for the fact that the students were not known to have criminal ties. Miguel Martínez, a representative for the families, said students at the school had fought back against extortion attempts by gangs last year, but it was not clear if that could have made them a target now.The students, by many accounts, had been soliciting money in Iguala for an Oct. 2 demonstration rejecting cuts to their state-financed school, which opened in 1926 and has long played a role in local social justice movements. Such student demonstrations are part of a well-known militancy that goes back decades and has provoked violence in the past. It did again this time, as students got into a skirmish with the police when they tried to steal buses to take to and from the demonstration, human rights groups said.The mayor and the police chief of Iguala are now on the run, having disappeared after being subpoenaed in the case, and the governor of the state confirmed that the local gang, known as Guerreros Unidos, had infiltrated the police force in Iguala, as well as other police departments in the state.The specter of corrupted police has haunted Mexico for years. But these disappearances come at a time when President Enrique Peña Nieto is already confronting the prosecution of at least three soldiers charged with homicide in another recent case — the shooting death of 22 people captured in a warehouse in June.“I feel deeply outraged and dismayed,” Mr. Peña Nieto told reporters Monday, referring to the violence here and dispatching the attorney general and other federal forces to the region. “I regret, in particular, the violence that occurred and especially that it was young students who were affected and whose rights were violated in the city of Iguala.” Mr. Peña Nieto’s predecessor, Felipe Calderón, also faced wave after wave of police corruption scandals, with some entire local forces dismissed. But experts say that, even as violence soared, both administrations fell behind in putting in place measures to hold law enforcement authorities accountable.Only this year did Mexico pass a law allowing members of the military to be tried in civilian courts for human rights abuses, and many feel that Mr. Peña Nieto has been more focused on shifting the dialogue to Mexico’s economy than on fighting corruption and improving security.“A serious and sustained effort at reforming local police agencies has been a pending agenda for a long time in Mexico,” said Matthew C. Ingram, an assistant professor at the University at Albany who studies justice in Mexico. “As long as local, municipal police agencies remain weak, they will not have the capacity to generate public trust or resist corruption and capture.”Here at the small, 500-student mountaintop teachers college, Escuela Normal Rural Raúl Isidro Burgos, where cows and stray dogs roam freely and walls are adorned with slogans like “protest is a right, repression is a crime,” a hodgepodge of human rights and radical groups and representatives of the families have vowed paralyzing strikes across the country on Wednesday to keep the pressure on the authorities for answers.Parents of the missing students doubt the effectiveness of state investigators. A team of forensic experts from Argentina with long experience in mass disappearance cases has arrived, and on Monday it began interviewing family members and collecting other data as part of an independent investigation, though it was unclear if the experts would have access to the bodies found.States officials said it could take at least two weeks and possibly longer to identify the remains because of their poor condition.And if the bodies are not those of the missing students, the question remains: Where did they come from?Several parents said they still hoped their children would be found alive. Although the number of missing has fluctuated, the current list of 43 was developed after students and human rights representatives said they had called family members and friends and searched school grounds and other places, failing to account for 43 classmates.“We have to keep looking and praying,” said Santa Cruz Castro, the father of Leonel.He last spoke to his son when Leonel called him the day of the confrontation, saying, “Don’t worry, Dad, I am going to the march,” which Mr. Cruz took to mean the collection drive in Iguala. “And then I didn’t hear from him and saw the news about the shootings. We didn’t know what to do.”In a sign of defiance and concern, placards and bumper stickers are popping up here and in other cities in Guerrero on buses, storefronts and buildings. Their slogan — #HastaEncontrarlos — means: “Until they are found.”Advertisement",50400824,845,231242,1740,174,4580,"0"

1292,And Here's a Guy Bending an iPhone 6 Plus With His Bare Hands,"Just a few hours ago, we started hearing reports that a small sampling of iPhone 6 Plus owners have experienced a slight bend to their phone after putting the device in their front pockets. And now, here's what appears to be video proof that—yep, this smartphone sure can bend. Although it sure takes some effort.Lou from Unbox Therapy puts the rumors to the test with his bare hands, and though it clearly takes quite a bit of force, he is able to give that handset one hell of an angle. The glass hangs in there, so it's still functional. And while it's clearly not something that will happen with normal use, the fact that it could happen at all is a bit concerning. According to experts, though, it probably shouldn't be surprising. As Jeremy Irons, a Design Engineer at Creative  Engineering explained: From  an engineering standpoint, the iPhone is an amazingly small and  delicately constructed device. The only thing really contributing to the  structural integrity of the iPhone 6 Plus is the thin aluminum frame  that covers the back and reaches around the sides. There is also another  very thin piece of steel behind the glass, but we are not working with  much as far as bending strength. Here's that oh-so-thin piece of steel from iFixit's iPhone 6 Plus teardown:But according to Irons, that's not going to be quite enough to make up for the strength lost to thinness: Previous  iPhones were thicker and not as long. In material bending, larger cross  sectional areas (thickness x width) and shorter lengths make things  stronger (You can't easily bend a cube), while the opposite makes things  very easy to bend (paper is easily folded). The increased length and  decreased thickness contribute to the weakness of the new iPhone.  Strength is proportionally related to length, but strength is affected  much more by changes in thickness. All other things being equal, this  0.5 mm change in thickness greatly affects the bending strength. While  the iPhone 5S was only 7% thicker than the iPhone 6 Plus, it was  actually 22% stronger in bending. When you make something longer,  it gets proportionally more bendable, when you make it thinner, it gets  a lot more bendable. Still, it's important to note that, though extreme in this case, a slight bending with use isn't all that uncommon, as Irons emphasizes:As a  disclaimer, we know nothing about the intricacies of the iPhone and this  is just speculation based on our engineering knowledge. I read that  phones often become bent during use and the pictures that are surfacing  may only be from extreme cases, and not an actual defect in the product.We've reached out to Apple for comment on the issue and will update as soon as we hear back.

Thus, it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Jones’s Greenwich house for inspiration. It’s because he is who he is that made me who I am today, Mo said.

                What Will Happen To 'Fast And Furious 7'?
              

","
              After the untimely death of star Paul Walker, Universal must decide what to do with the next 'Fast and Furious' movie.
        
          The death Saturday of actor Paul Walker, known for his work in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise as well as earlier roles in ""Varsity Blues,"" ""Pleasantville"" and other films, left the world stunned. While fans process the tragedy and police unravel the Santa Clarita, Calif. car accident that took the life of the 40-year-old Walker, studio executives at Universal have the unhappy decision of what to do with the car-centric franchise Walker was so widely recognized for. As is the case with any death, there are obligations and entanglements to be sorted through on behalf of the deceased. Walker was in the midst of filming ""Fast & the Furious 7,"" due to be released July 11, 2014. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the cast and crew had taken a Thanksgiving hiatus, and were scheduled to resume filming in Atlanta on Sunday, Dec. 1. Instead, director James Wan (a newcomer to the franchise) and Universal execs held a conference call to discuss the future of the movie and how to work around Walker's untimely death.No announcements have been made about a rewrite, change in release date, recasting, digital face replacement or any of the other possible workarounds used in the past when an actor died mid-production. In the very early hours of Sunday morning, Wan tweeted that he was ""beyond heartbroken."" I am so beyond heartbroken right now. I can't process anything.— James Wan (@creepypuppet) DecemberI am so beyond heartbroken right now. I can't process anything. 1, 2013Universal released a statement Saturday night: ""All of us at Universal are heartbroken,"" it said. ""Paul was truly one of the most beloved and respected members of our studio family for 14 years, and this loss is devastating to us, to everyone involved with theFast and Furious films, and to countless fans. We send our deepest and most sincere condolences to Paul's family.""The official ""Fast and Furious"" Facebook page posted an image of Walker leaning against a car, captioned ""always in our hearts.""Walker has been involved in the franchise from the very beginning; 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious"" revolved around his undercover cop character, Brian O'Conner, attempting to worm in with a ring of fast-driving, law-bending criminals.The earliest that production on ""Fast 7"" would resume is Tuesday, sources told Buzzfeed Entertainment. The cast, including Walker, was reportedly also scheduled to meet in Abu Dhabi in January to film additional scenes.",5025454,5804,37793,1247,189,7352,"1"
1323,"New Dog-ma? Pope Says Heaven Is for Hounds, Too","BREAKING: Judge won't block Biden administration’s new eviction moratoriumSectionsTVFeaturedMore from NBC Follow NBC News Editor’s note: News organizations around the world pounced on comments, originally misreported by Italian media, that Pope Francis said animals can go to heaven. It turns out he never said that, but a similar comment reportedly made by a pope decades ago may have added to the confusion.Pope Francis' declaration that there are pups in paradise didn't come as a surprise to Boston College theologian Thomas Groome.""There must be dogs in heaven. Or else it wouldn't be heaven,"" Groome said, quoting his grand-niece. He paused and quipped, ""Now cats? I don't know about that. Cats would be more of a leap of faith for me.""The pontiff's comments on the eternal animal kingdom happened earlier this week as he consoled a little boy whose dog had recently died.""One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,” he said, according to Italian news sources.The remark thrilled vegans who apparently forgot the Pope loves a good steak and annoyed traditionalists who would like to muzzle the Vatican's most voluble occupant.John Vennari, editor of Catholic Family News and a staunch traditionalist, said the pope displayed ""a triumph of sentiment over adherence to the firm doctrine that the church always taught throughout the ages.""It might move the person's heart and make them feel good, but it has no basis in Catholic teaching,"" Vennari said.His take: animals share external and internal senses with humans but don't have the will and intellect that form the basis of a ""soul,"" and their life force dies with them and does not go to heaven.""That's the basic teaching,"" Vennari said.Does the pope's conversation with a grieving child change that? Traditionalists agree it does not.""But it creates a confusion on the very idea of salvation,"" Vennari said. ""Did Christ die for my cat? Did Christ die for my dog? No. Christ died for human beings.""Groome, on the other hand, says the pope is on firm theological ground.""The biblical evidence is that all life comes forth from God and all life returns into God,"" said the professor, a proud owner of a loyal Shih-tzu named Riley. ""The Bible is quite clear about it.""That's also the interpretation of Sarah King, who heads Christian outreach at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.""The timing couldn't be more divine,"" she said, noting that PETA has launched a yuletide campaign called Jesus People for Animals with a website that explores such issues as whether Christ really ate fish.""We hope the pope's word will encourage more people to direct kindness and mercy toward animals and the first step is to stop eating meat,"" King said.But Francis is from Argentina, one of the world's biggest meat-eating countries, and grilled sirloin is one of his favorite dishes. Doesn't that send a mixed message?""It absolutely does,"" King said, somewhat less sunnily.Groome doubts that the pope wants Catholics to give up meat.""I don't think he's condemning a cow and having good steaks,"" he said. ""You can say the cow serves its purpose and is now going to heaven.""True or not, most dog-owners in New York's Central Park were happy to think that the pearly gates have a dog door.""I would like to hope that is true,"" said Lauren Dichiara. ""It'd be great if we can skip down the yellow brick road in heaven.""© 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",8605117,1842,28074,1531,702,131925,"0"

		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	A Chick-fil-A manager is so irritated at his staff’s use of slang that he compiled a list of terms the employees are forbidden to use. The missive has gone viral in social media.Among the banned words that ruffled his feathers:“Chill (unless we are talking about something that is chilled),” “Fool,” “Cuz (this goes for cousin and because), “Bruh,” “Bae” and “Guh.”Even the word “Ebola” is off-limits.“Stop accusing people of having ebola,” Eric, whose last name is unknown, reportedly warned the staff in the letter, a copy of which was posted to Reddit on Nov. 6.“You will speak properly when you walk through these doors,” he wrote. “You are a professional so speak professionally.”He also warned them not to deface the list by crossing out any of the words.“Scratch it out + you lose your employee meals!” he added by hand to the typed document.One of the workers posted a copy of the note on Reddit, writing: “I work at Chick-fil-a and Eric, our manager, is tired of our s***.”The post has gotten more than 1,300 comments.Calls to Chick-fil-A were not immediately returned.Share Selection",2266263,11104,8053,1158,1930,279836,"0"

1376,Audio may have captured Michael Brown shooting,"An audio recording released Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer Aug. 9.The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.Both Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest.Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.The organization Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organization's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.A press conference is set for 1 p.m. CT Tuesday at the U.S. District court building in St. Louis.Follow @RobinAria on Twitter.",4421629,886,202786,1303,6,366,"1"

1384,Dogs in Heaven? Pope Francis Leaves Pearly Gates Open,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Rick GladstonePope Francis has given hope to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory. Now, he has endeared himself to dog lovers, animal rights activists and vegans.During a weekly general audience at the Vatican last month, the pope, speaking of the afterlife, appeared to suggest that animals could go to heaven, asserting, “Holy Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us.”Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper, analyzing the pope’s remarks, concluded he believed animals have a place in the afterlife. It drew an analogy to comforting words that Pope Paul VI was said to have once told a distraught boy whose dog had died: “One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures.”The news accounts of Francis’ remarks were welcomed by groups like the Humane Society of the United States and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, who saw them as a repudiation of conservative Roman Catholic theology that says animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls.“My inbox got flooded,” said Christine Gutleben, senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the United States. “Almost immediately, everybody was talking about it.”Charles Camosy, an author and professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University, said it was difficult to know precisely what Francis meant, since he spoke “in pastoral language that is not really meant to be dissected by academics.” But asked whether the remarks had caused a new debate on whether animals have souls, suffer and go to heaven, Mr. Camosy said, “In a word: absolutely.”In his relatively short tenure as leader of the world’s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI, Francis, 77, has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church. He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues like homosexuality, single motherhood and unwed couples. So to some extent, it was not a surprise that Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals, would suggest that they have a place in heaven.In his remarks, as reported by Vatican Radio, Francis said of paradise: “It’s lovely to think of this, to think we will find ourselves up there. All of us in heaven. It’s good, it gives strength to our soul.“At the same time, the Holy Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us, and that came out of the thought and the heart of God.”Theologians cautioned that Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of America, the Catholic magazine, said he believed that Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation,” even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals.The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church’s history. Pope Pius IX, who led the church from 1846 to 1878, longer than any other pope, strongly supported the doctrine that dogs and other animals have no consciousness. He even sought to thwart the founding of an Italian chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.Pope John Paul II appeared to reverse Pius in 1990 when he proclaimed that animals do have souls and are “as near to God as men are.” But the Vatican did not widely publicize his assertion, perhaps because it so directly contradicted Pius, who was the first to declare the doctrine of papal infallibility in 1854.John Paul’s successor, Benedict, seemed to emphatically reject his view in a 2008 sermon in which he asserted that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on earth.”Ms. Gutleben of the Humane Society said Francis’ apparent reversal of Benedict’s view could be enormous. “If the pope did mean that all animals go to heaven, then the implication is that animals have a soul,” she said. “And if that’s true, then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them. We have to admit that these are sentient beings, and they mean something to God.”Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA, one of the most activist anti-slaughterhouse groups, said the pope’s remarks vindicated the biblical portrayal of heaven as peaceful and loving, and could influence eating habits, moving Catholics away from consuming meat — which she asserted had already been happening anyway. “It’s a vegan world, life over death and peace between species,” she said. “I’m not a Catholic historian, but PETA’s motto is that animals aren’t ours, and Christians agree. Animals aren’t ours, they’re God’s.”Whether the pope’s remarks will prove to be a persuasive new reason not to eat meat, a potentially worrisome development to the multibillion-dollar beef, pork, poultry and seafood industries, remains unclear at best. But they did cause discussion.“As on quite a few other things Pope Francis has said, his recent comments on all animals going to heaven have been misinterpreted,” Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said in an email. “They certainly do not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin.” Mr. Warner quoted passages from Genesis that say man is given “dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on earth.”“While that ‘dominion’ means use for human benefit, it also requires stewardship — humane care and feeding — something all farmers who raise animals practice every day of every year,” Mr. Warner said.Father Martin said he did not believe the pope’s remarks could be construed as a comment on vegetarianism. But, he said, “he’s reminding us that all creation is holy and that in his mind, paradise is open to all creatures, and frankly, I agree with him.”Laura Hobgood-Oster, professor of religion and environmental studies at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Tex., and an expert on the history of dog-human interaction, said she believed that there would be a backlash from religious conservatives, but that it would take time.“The Catholic Church has never been clear on this question; it’s all over the place, because it begs so many other questions,” she said. “Where do mosquitoes go, for God’s sake?”Advertisement",50400832,845,184451,1192,2150,420372,"0"

1392,Banksy Paints New Mural to Prove He’s Not in Jail,"
Henri Neuendorf, 
																October 22, 2014
Following false rumors that police had possibly arrested Banksy (see “Has Banksy Been Arrested Outside London?“), the British street artist has painted a new piece, the Telegraph reports. The work was created on the side of a building near the docks in the English city of Bristol, but by Tuesday morning the mural had already been defaced with a splatter of black paint.The mural, entitled Girl with a Pierced Eardrum (2014), parodies Johannes Vermeer’s masterpiece Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665) and features a yellow outdoor alarm box as the girl’s earring. The artist published a series of photographs of the new work on his website, without commenting on the fake story about his arrest and outing as a mid-aged British man named Paul Horner.On Tuesday an unknown vandal splattered part of the mural in black paintPhoto: ITV News West CountryOn Monday a story published on the satirical American news website National Report claimed that London’s Metropolitan Police had arrested the artist on charges of “vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting.” The false arrest reports that his studio had been raided by Police turned out to be recycled story from a previous hoax.The Girl with the Pierced Eardrum (2014) follows Banksy’s recent pieces Art Buff (2014), in Folkestone, England, which was vandalized only weeks after appearing (see “Phallic Addition to Folkestone Banksy Mural“), and Birds of a Feather (2014) which was removed by the local government who deemed it to be racist (see “Immigration-Themed Banksy Mural Destroyed by Local Council“).It is the second time this year the artist has graced his hometown of Bristol with a Banksy original. Shortly after Mobile Lovers was unveiled on Banksy’s website, it was controversially snatched by the leader of a local youth club hoping to keep his struggling organization afloat (see “Youth Club Removes New Banksy with Crowbar“). The artist later gave the club his blessing, and it was sold to benefit the group (see “Banksy Gives Controversial Mobile Lovers Artwork to Bristol Youth Club” and “Sale of Banksy’s Mobile Lovers for $670,000 Saves Youth Club“).Share

1397,The Resurrection of Kristen Stewart,"SEARCHIt’s been two years since the end of Twilight and that tabloid hullabaloo. Now, the actress is back with a trio of standout performances in indie films. She opens up about her latest chapter.
It’s been two years since the end of Twilight and that tabloid hullabaloo. Now, the actress is back with a trio of standout performances in indie films. She opens up about her latest chapter.Senior Entertainment EditorKristen Stewart looks like a new woman. Yes, it’s an odd thing to say about a 24-year-old, but the steely-eyed Angeleno isn’t your typical twenty-something. At age 11, she tackled a pivotal seizure sequence for David Fincher in Panic Room with such ferocity that she burst several blood vessels in her eyes. “She reminded me of a young Jodie Foster,” said Fincher. She’s been forged in the crucible of Hollywood, enduring a polarizing film franchise (Twilight), tabloid controversy, and incessant scrutiny—and emerged all the wiser. These days, she’s decidedly more Joan Jett than Bella Swan.Stewart’s just emerged from her slumber and met me at the lobby lounge of the Greenwich Hotel, a hipper-than-thou hotel in Downtown New York, looking effortlessly striking in a baggy white T—exposing a right forearm tattoo of the illuminated eye in Picasso’s Guernica—black jeans, and short, dark hair. She got the bit of body art after wrapping Clouds of Sils Maria, a Swiss-set surrealist flick helmed by French master Olivier Assayas and also starring Juliette Binoche. It’s one of three indie films that’s earned Stewart heavy acclaim on the festival circuit, along with her gripping turn as a daughter struggling to cope with her mother’s  (Julianne Moore) deterioration from Alzheimer’s in Still Alice, for which she’ll receive a “major Oscar push” from distributor Sony Pictures Classics, and last but not least, as PFC Amy Cole, a green guard at Guantánamo in Camp X-Ray, in theaters Oct. 17. In Camp X-Ray, her guard is initially happy to serve her country in the wake of 9/11, but after observing the treatment of the prisoners there, and striking up an unlikely friendship with one of the detainees (Peyman Maadi, A Separation), she begins to have a change of heart.After ordering coffee, we discuss her resurgence.Camp X-Ray was shot on a shoestring budget of $1 million, but it looks much bigger than that.It’s weird to say that the scope of it is pretty small considering what you see, but if you think about it, we had essentially three locations and shot it in 20 days. The key to the budget is it was so fast and we just gunned it.It had been two years since you shot your last film, Snow White and the Huntsman. Were you being extra picky in the wake of Twilight because you knew you were under the microscope?I’m never really that precious about choosing projects that don’t have every sure element that is a guaranteed good experience and/or success. There’s a lot of risk involved in this job, and it doesn’t bother me. This could’ve been a terrible movie! It could’ve been awful. It’s with a first-time director. But I still would’ve gotten what I got out of it had the movie not turned out as well as it did.You tend to take those leaps. I remember Leonardo DiCaprio once saying that he has a policy of never working with first-time directors.It’s smart. I’ve had experiences that have made me go, “Ugh, I have to be careful and make sure that every part is sturdy and that I won’t be let down.” If I was a director, I would be extremely conscious of my filmography. It says so much about the difference between putting your name on something and owning it instead of being one tiny part of it. Actors get to work all the time. If I make a bad movie every once in a while, I don’t care. I didn’t work after Snow White for about two years, but it’s because a lot of these projects didn’t come together. I’m decisive, but I’m definitely not a planner.I have these talks with friends, and I’ll say, “Kristen Stewart’s a good actress,” and they disagree. Then I ask them what films they’ve seen of yours, and they just say, “The Twilight movies.” So, they haven’t seen, say, Panic Room, Speak, Into the Wild, Adventureland, etc. Do you feel like that series has unfairly colored people’s opinions of your acting ability?  Honestly, I don’t care. It’s fine. I’m really happy doing what I’m doing. I’m sure there are a ton of people out there who would hate my movies even if they saw all those, just as I’m sure there are people out there who are obsessed with Twilight and say, “I watched the series, and she completely let me down, and then I watched every one of her other movies, and I fuckin’ hate her!” And that’s cool! Just don’t watch my movies.With Camp X-Ray, this is pretty heavy subject matter here in Gitmo. President Obama promised to close the place down in 2009, but hasn’t done so yet. Was part of the attraction to the project shining a light in this bizarre blight on America? I was forced to really investigate. I knew that Obama wanted to close it down, and I knew that everyone else wanted to, too. Most people you talk to in America have kind of put it out of their minds. I didn’t jump on this movie to make a huge political statement, but it’s such an interesting story within an interesting context, and it’s more of a poke on the shoulder to remind you that this thing is here.Your character’s relationship with Peyman’s detainee reminds us of the humanity of these people. We tend to view suspected terrorists as this nameless, faceless “other,” when they’re human beings, too.As Americans, we should absolutely aspire to more than that. If you label something “bad,” people will justify the most terrible things. Just because you’re following a greater whole, suddenly you take the individual out of it and no one bears responsibility for anything.The film doesn’t show any of the more controversial practices at Gitmo—like waterboarding, sleep deprivation, force-feeding, etc.   It alludes to it. But if we showed all that stuff, people would instantly demonize the film. You see something like that and it becomes so polarizing. Yes, it was cool to be in a Gitmo movie, it was cool to play a soldier, and it was cool remind people that this still exists, but I also thought it was cool to play a simple, American girl who wanted to find her line and aspire to something bigger than her—only to find that things aren’t so simple. Most people in every state think, “Well, of course it’s a great thing to sign up for the Army,” and there’s no question asked beyond that—ever.She really gets swept up in all the post 9/11 patriotism and signs up for Gitmo duty, only to find that it isn’t what she thought at all.She’s simple, not very smart, and really socially inadequate—but a good person. So, if you can sign up, put a uniform on, and erase yourself, you don’t have to consider yourself anymore. You can take the individual out of it and say, “Well, this dignifies me. I’m good because of this.” And when that doesn’t end up being true, you actually have to contend with who you are. All she wants is to think, “They did 9/11, they’re bad, fuck that, I’m going to do my job and I’m going to do it well.” But then she gets down there and just can’t accept it; she can’t conform to that.Right. The mistake we make is not viewing these detainees down there as people, too. We’re all people.  That is essentially so fucking evil, it’s crazy. It’s a ridiculous idea for you to think that you know anything for sure in life—other than to take care of your fellow people. Where the fuck do you get off thinking otherwise? These two people couldn’t be from more different worlds and perspectives, and probably disagree fundamentally on most things, but there’s a through-line for all of us—and that’s what people forget, and that’s what makes people capable of doing terrible things to each other. What makes you different from any other person that walks the earth?This is a pretty ripped-from-the-headlines film. What issues are you passionate about in the news?I don’t want to talk about that shit at all. Trust me, I’m only asking for it. When it comes time to stand up and affect change, I’m not the type of person to shout from the rooftops. Just because you’re an actor and in the public eye, people think that’s how you must be. But there are other ways to do that. That’s not me.When you talk about Camp X-Ray, Still Alice, and Clouds of Sils Maria, these are three films anchored by strong, flawed, complex women. These films tend to be a rarity in Hollywood, and usually come in smaller indie packages.Me and Juliette [Binoche] were talking about it because this question does come up, and she said, “Oh, I don’t answer that question anymore. It’s so cliché.” And I said, “Well, it’s so cliché because it’s entirely true.” And she said, “Yes, maybe in Hollywood.” Because in France, due to the history of French directors having romantic relationships with their lead actresses, they tend to tell more female-centric stories. In America, there are way more male filmmakers than female ones, and they want to tell more masculine stories. Most of our great films that we’re proud of, you’ve got Bob De Niro, Jack Nicholson, and the bravado is overwhelming. And that’s still going on. I read a million scripts and people say I choose my scripts carefully, but it’s just so obvious when the role is different, and complex, and not some typical, archetypal girl, because they’re so rare. Not to sound cliché, but it’s a male-dominated and driven business.“It’s A Man’s World,” to quote James Brown.[Laughs] Yeah. But that’s OK, because it’s fun to be the underdog.There just needs to be more female filmmakers.Exactly! That’s it. I’ll do it.A case study would be your Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke. This is a very accomplished filmmaker and, five years after directing that hit, her latest film basically went straight-to-video. That has to be indicative of  a larger problem within the industry, that she was basically given one Red Riding Hood before her power was stripped away. A male director is given a lot more chances.Yeah, that’s true. That’s a thing that women have to do—you must persevere. That’s what we’ve been doing. You need to make something that’s undeniably good. If a woman makes a bad movie, or does something stupid, then the door just slams shut. It’s fucked up.A lot of young actresses these days are coming out against being labeled a feminist. It seems to be a generational thing, where people from the older generation see it for its definition—equality for men and women—while the younger generation for some reason views it as a more divisive term.I know what you mean. That’s such a strange thing to say, isn’t it? Like, what do you mean? Do you not believe in equality for men and women? I think it’s a response to overly-aggressive types. There are a lot of women who feel persecuted and go on about it, and I sometimes am like, “Honestly, just relax, because now you’re going in the other direction.” Sometimes, the loudest voice in the room isn’t necessarily the one you should listen to. By our nature alone, think about what you’re saying and say it—but don’t scream in people’s faces, because then you’re discrediting us.Relating it to my one little avenue, people say, “If you want to make it in the film industry as a woman, you have to be a bitch.” No, you are going to ruin any chance you have and give us a bad name. It’s the overcompensation to where our generation goes, “Relax,” because it’s been easier for us, and because we don’t have as much of the anger, so it’s like we can’t get behind it and it’s a bit embarrassing. But that being said, it’s a really ridiculous thing to say you’re not a feminist.",48042,988,1420,737,281,7764,"0"

1415,Bend-gate: Apple iPhone 6 Plus found bending in pants pockets,"We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.This was published 6 years agoDubbed ""bend-gate"", some iPhone 6 Plus owners have discovered their new phone's aluminium body literally bending in their pockets.Unlike LG's bendy G FLEX and numerous other bendy phones that came out earlier this year, the iPhone 6 was not made to bend.MacRumors, which first reported on the issue, said ""a small but growing number"" of iPhone 6 Plus owners had reported in their forums that their phone had been bent after carrying the device in their pockets. In one example, a new 6 Plus was bent during a day of ""dancing, dining, and driving to a wedding"".Other users have found it bends when only a nominal amount of force is applied.PD13 said this bend occurred after lightly bumping into someone.Credit:MacRumors/PD13Russell Holly, a reporter for Geek.com, said he had also experienced the issue.""Shortly after reading these reports I checked out my own iPhone 6 and discovered a similar - but significantly less noticeable - effect,"" he said.""Much like these other reports, my phone had been in my front pocket for an extended period of time while I was driving.""The claims have been backed up by numerous images uploaded online of iPhone 6 Plus models with a kink in them.iBoost621 posted this picture of an iPhone 6 Plus with a kink in it.Credit:MacRumors/iBoost621One MacRumors forum user, PD13, said their phone bent significantly after they bumped into someone with it in their pocket.""It was a light bump, not even close to the force that should have been required to bend it,"" they said. ""I've had significantly harder impacts to my 4s and never had any type of breakage or bending problems.""MacRumors user DevinPitcher shows off a bent iPhone.Credit:MacRumors/DevinPitcherPD13 said they used a phone case that wasn't very durable and would be upgrading to a sturdier one.iPhone 6 Plus owners are also being warned against bending their phones back into shape due to the risk of its screen cracking.A distinct curve in an iPhone 6 Plus.Credit:MacRumors/hanzohOne user found out the hard way when he demonstrated this for a YouTube video.The new iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch (diagonal) screen and is made of aluminium, which is known to bend if pressure is applied.Another blog covering Apple, Cult of Mac, noted that Apple phones weren't the only ones to have issues with bending over the years.""Any phone made of metal is still subject to the laws of physics, but to reiterate, this isn't exactly a problem exclusive to the iPhone 6,"" it reported.It listed the Samsung Galaxy S4, iPhone 5s, Sony Xperia Z1, iPhone 5, BlackBerry Q10, HTC EVO, Oppo and iPhone 4s had all suffered from bending.Apple has been contacted for comment.Ben Grubb is a journalist and homepage editor for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.Copyright © 2021",843808,749,5919,740,231,3876,"0"

1428,Beheading Suspect Attended Same Mosque as 9/11 Terrorist,"Saad Mohammed, the Board Chair of Oklahoma’s Council on American-Islamic Relations, told Breitbart Texas that Nolen attended services at the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City (ISGOC) every Friday.“He always sat in the back, he was very quiet and very low key,” Mohammed said. “Not someone you would notice right away. If you were to walk into an empty room, you wouldn’t have noticed him…He was a little odd, a little strange in the way he carried himself. But we [at the mosque] never made anything of it.”Nolan first started attending ISGOC in May.While Mohammed denies that his mosque encourages radicalization, he revealed that Moussaoui also attended ISGOC. Mohammed recalled Moussaoui expressing a dislike towards non-Muslims. “I lectured a class that day, and [Moussaoui] said he disagreed with non-Muslims being in the Mosque,” Mohammed said. “We didn’t pay any attention because that’s just how some people think. But you know, look what happened. So we’re going to try to monitor for [strange behavior] more.”At this point, however, it is unclear how ISGOC monitors alarming behavior. Massaoui, who is a French citizen, is currently serving a life sentence without parole in Colorado. FBI reports show that in early 2001, Massaoui displayed odd, alienating behavior at ISGOC; he approached Suhaib Webb, the mosque’s former Imam, and asked, “Why don’t you tell the Muslims they should leave the land of the Infidel?”Webb himself, and his history of radicalization, has also raised eyebrows. Webb, who now serves as Imam of the sister organization of the mosque attended by the Boston Bomber suspects, has ties to former Al Qaeda mastermind Anwar al-Awlaki. “We do have people here who have an extreme way of thinking,” Mohammed admitted. “What I mean by that is [they think], ‘The way I practice Islam is right, you’re wrong. My school of thought is the best, your’s is a little shaky.’ We have that.”Still, he insisted that “down with America” mindsets are not present at the mosque.  Referring to the recent incident involving Nolen, Mohammed said, “This is not something that’s going to be widespread. We’re going to keep our eye out for this.”He added, though, that “it’s impossible to completely stop” violence, “because you don’t know what people are thinking.”Follow Kristin Tate on Twitter @KristinBTate. Border / Cartel ChroniclesBeheadingIslam.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Protect Yourself From Big Tech!Thank You!Copyright © 2021 Breitbart",1464214,111,21843,2797,267,6141,"1"

1432,Paul Walker’s Death: ‘Fast & Furious 7’ Delayed But Won’t Be Scrapped,"Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood ReporterSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood ReporterUPDATED: The movie was on hiatus for Thanksgiving when Walker died in a car crash Saturday; Universal brass held a meeting Sunday morning to discuss the fate of the film.

His penultimate entry in the Fast & Furious franchise, Fast 6 was one of the biggest hits of 2013. It took in an obscene $788.6 million, worldwide, and pre-production on the seventh started before it was even released.Universal and the team behind Fast & Furious 7 are facing a delay in production following the tragic death of actor Paul Walker, but sources say the movie will not be abandoned entirely.Walker, along with the rest of the cast and crew of Fast 7, had been scheduled to return to Atlanta on Sunday to resume shooting the big-budget film, which features extensive car racing. Those plans are on hold until Monday or Tuesday at the earliest.PHOTOS: Paul Walker and Other Notable Deaths of 2013Director James Wan and Universal executives held a conference call Sunday morning to discuss the state of the film, whether rewrites would be necessary and how to proceed in a manner that would be respectful to Walker’s death. Walker, 40, was a favorite on the set of the Fast movies, and his death has left his fellow stars, including Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, and the crew devastated. 








Fast 7, which was well underway shooting in Atlanta, was on hiatus for the Thanksgiving holiday. Walker had returned to Southern California when the limited-edition Porsche he was a passenger in crashed Saturday afternoon in Valencia, bursting into flames. The driver has been identified as Roger Rodas, a well-respected financial adviser and the CEO of Walker’s company Always Evolving (the duo met because of their shared passion for cars).Walker was reprising his role as Brian O’Conner in Fast 7. The seventh film in the racing-centric action franchise is slated to hit theaters July 11. The film is on an expedited schedule in order to make that release date (Justin Lin, the director of previous installments, bowed out in part because he didn’t want to work on the speedy timeline), so any delay in production could impact that release date. In addition, marketing Fast 7 could pose a challenge, considering Walker died in a crash of a flashy car similar to those used in the movies.PHOTOS: Paul Walker’s Career in Pictures Insiders say a large part of the film had been shot, although in January, Walker and the rest of the Fast 7 team were scheduled to travel to Abu Dhabi to film additional scenes.“All of us at Universal are heartbroken,” a studio spokesperson said in a statement Saturday night. “Paul was truly one of the most beloved and respected members of our studio family for 14 years, and this loss is devastating to us, to everyone involved with the Fast and Furious films, and to countless fans. We send our deepest and most sincere condolences to Paul’s family.” 








The studio declined to comment on the future of Fast 7.In January 2008, director Terry Gilliam faced a similar situation when Heath Ledger died in the middle of shooting The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. The independent film suspended production temporarily. Ultimately, Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell came aboard to portray various versions of Ledger’s character.Ledger’s death also came just as Warner Bros. was ramping up marketing for The Dark Knight. The studio didn’t shy away from showing images of Ledger as the Joker throughout the campaign, despite the macabre nature of Ledger’s character.STORY: Hollywood Pays Tribute to Paul Walker Two films starring Walker are awaiting release: Hurricane Katrina drama Hours, due out in December, and Brick Mansions, now in postproduction. Brick Mansions, from EuropaCorp and Relativity Media, is an English-language remake of the 2004 French action movie District B13. Pantelion Films, a joint venture between Lionsgate and Televisa, acquired North American rights to Hours in August and is tentatively planning a dual release in theaters and on VOD.

Friends also recounted the story of him recently finding an abandoned, emaciated puppy that he nursed back to heath and then re-homed.'Found him a pretty home, hope he has a good life,' Cirillo wrote just four weeks ago of the pup.Where is he? Heartbreaking images show dogs peeking out from beneath Corporal Nathan Cirillo's family home on Thursday, a day after he was shot dead outside the ParliamentForlorn: The two dogs peeked out from beneath the fence at the family's home in Hamilton, OntarioMissed: Cirillo had two German shepherd-type dogs and recently nursed an abandoned puppy to healthCirillo, who was shot dead as he stood guard at the National War Memorial outside the Canadian Parliament on Wednesday, also leaves behind a six-year-old son.He was bringing up the boy, Marcus, alone - with help from his mother, Kathy - after the boy's mother was no longer in the picture, friends have said. Former girlfriend Randi Lotsberg said that Cirillo lit up whenever he spoke about his son. 'He stepped up. Definitely admirable,' she told The Star. 'I feel so bad right now for his kid. Now his son doesn't have a dad.'Tragic: The animal-loving Hamilton, Ontario native was shot at close range and rushed to a nearby hospitalFamily: Cirillo leaves behind his two dogs and his six-year-old son Marcus, left, who he was bringing up aloneWaiting: Cirillo's son is now expected to stay with his mother, Kathy, who has helped with his careHe met the boy's mother, Kendra, at the Ancaster Fair in Jerseyville after he was kicked out for not paying to get in. Outside he met Kendra and a friend, who asked for a ride home,Metro News reported. They dated and went on to have Marcus.   Cirillo's mother Kathy, who is traveling to Ottawa, will now likely take care of Marcus, CBC reported. She took care of him when Cirillo was working or away on his military duties, Lotsberg said.Nathan's uncle Jim Cirillo told reporters from a home in Hamilton that the soldier's mother is in total shock.'She's saying she doesn't believe it,' he told CBC. 'She went on the internet and she saw it and she...I don't know how she didn't pass out. She's just completely broken, broken right now.'Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina said that he had visited a makeshift memorial to Cirillo outside his regiment's barracks before going to the family's home with Police Chief Glenn De Caire.  As he spoke to the slain soldier's relatives, little Marcus wandered out to greet everyone. He likely didn't understand what had just happened, the mayor said. Seconds before: A tourist snapped this photo, likely the last ever taken of Corporal Nathan Cirillo (left) before he was gunned down by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in an attack on Ottowa's Parliament Hill on WednesdayOminous: Responders frantically tried reviving Cirillo at the base of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier'At what point does a five-year-old actually understand that?' Bratina asked.Cirillo had dreamed of serving his country since he was a teenager. He became a cadet when he was just 13 and joined the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders about five years ago.Friends said he loved country music and was a fitness fanatic who had worked as a personal trainer.'Nathan was a good man,' friend Marie Michele told CBC News. 'He would give anything to anyone.''He always had a smile on his face,' his friend Peter DiBussolo told The Ottawa Citizen. 'He was always walking around giving people handshakes, introducing people to himself.' Manager Billy Pozeg of Club Absinthe, where Cirillo worked as a bouncer, told CBC Cirillo often showed up straight from the armury in his fatigues. Paying respects: A man wearing an Argylls jacket places flowers at a memorial outside the gates of the John Weir Foote Armory, the home of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of CanadaEmotional memorial: A woman holds her head at the impromptu memorial in Hamilton, where 24-year-old fallen reservist Corporal Nathan Cirillo was being honoredLoved: People sign a Canadian flag at a makeshift memorial to Cirillo outside of The Lieutenant-Colonel John Weir Foote Armoury in Hamilton, Ontario on ThursdayNo matter how tired he was from back-to-back shifts, he lifted the mood of every room he entered, Pozeg said. Last photos: This image of a happy Cirillo was taken by a tourist in the days before his deathOn a Facebook memorial page, set up just hours after Cirillo's death, friends and loved ones recounted stories of his kindness.  One described an incident where she had traveled to Hamilton for a night out with friends but they were unable to meet her - but Cirillo was there. 'Nathan stayed in downtown after he had finished with the army and waited for me even though it was snowing and well below 0C and my bus was over an hour late,' Megan Newman wrote.'He stood at the station and waited and took me home, he even had a coffee in his hand for me. He was a true stand-up guy, who lived for his son and family also the military. He will be a big miss.'  Family members said they found out Cirillo was the victim after seeing footage on the news.'When I saw the ambulance take him in and I saw his receding hairline, I knew it was my nephew,' an unidentified aunt told the Globe and Mail.  On Wednesday, he was photographed by a Parliament Hill visitor standing by the Tomb mere moments before the attack.The Hamilton, Ontario native served Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada. That regiment is one of the country's largest army reserve units in Canada and guarding the National War Memorial is part soldiers' ceremonial duties. Saddened: Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen also paid their respects on Thursday by leaving flowers at the site where the soldier was gunned downRemembered: Flowers with a card sit at the foot of the War Memorial in Ottawa on Thursday'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. 'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.' The reservists are rotated on an hourly or bi-hourly basis, and it could have been any of the men -- some part-time and others full -- who served the duty on Parliament Hill Wednesday in their Black Watch tartan kilt, Glengarry and other regimental garb. But the fate befell Cirillo.Many of his closest friends were in his regiment, including Brendan Stevenson, who was believed to be standing beside him at the grave of the unknown soldier when he was shot, according to Maclean's.  Seconds later after the photo was taken, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cirillo, whose ceremonial weapon was not loaded. The soldier was rushed to a hospital, but soon succumbed to the wounds.Twitter user Kamakazi19982 posted the photo with the caption: 'Ok so we were on a tour at the war monument in Ottawa a few minutes ago, a few seconds later there was a shooting.'  The horror began when a masked Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot and killed Cirillo standing guard at Canada's war memorial Wednesday, then stormed Parliament in an attack that was stopped cold when he was shot to death by the ceremonial sergeant-at-arms.Another constable Samearn Son was shot in the leg but is expected to make a full recovery. Canada's prime minister called it the country's second terrorist attack in three days.The country was already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run assault Monday against two Canadian soldiers by a man Harper described as an 'ISIS-inspired terrorist.' Gunned down: He had been in Ottawa because members of the Argylls were standing guard this weekLoss: 24-year-old Carillo served with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Hamilton, OntarioFriends described Cirillo as a fitness fanatic. The 24-year-old worked part-time as a personal trainer as well as a bouncer at a Hamilton nightclubOne soldier was killed in the first attack. 'We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated,' Prime Minister Stephen Harper vowed in an address to the nation. Investigators offered little information about the gunman but he is the son of Susan Bibeau who works for the Immigration and Refuge Board of Canada. On Thursday, Ms Bibeau spoke from her home to apologize for her son's actions.'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow.''We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.'     On Thursday, sergeant-in-arms Kevin Vickers was given a hero's welcome to parliament with a standing ovation from politicians across the political spectrum. Gunman: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the Muslim convert who shot dead solider Nathan Cirillo and opened fire on Canadian ParliamentRace: An Ottawa police officer runs with his weapon drawn outside Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday after multiple gunmen attacked the Parliament and a nearby mall, injuring at least three peopleRace: Emergency personnel tend to the soldier after he was shot at the National Memorial just before 10amTerror: Police hunted the streets for more suspects and as they asked the public to stay away from the areaIn a statement he paid tribute to his fallen colleague. 'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events.

Ex-policeman Mr Vickers has held the position for eight years.MP Craig Scott wrote on Twitter: ‘MPs … owe their safety, even lives, to sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms.’Minister Julian Fantino added that he was ‘profoundly grateful’ for Mr Vickers’ ‘selfless act.' In Parliament on Thursday the public servant was greeted with a moving standing ovation An emotional Mr Vickers gave a humble nod of his head at the ceremony as he bravely returned to work just a day after saving the lives of his co-workers His sister, Mary, told the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.''He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'Vickers released a statement Thursday afternoon. 'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events.

1473,"HP to split into two companies, report says","Do Not Sell The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Sunday that HP (HPQ) plans to put the PC and printer operations under one roof and its business that provides software and services to corporate customers under another.  The Journal said the announcement could come as soon as Monday, and that the separation would take place next year.  HP spokeswoman Sarah Pompei declined to comment on the report.  The split follows a number of spinoffs and breakups this year. Most recently, eBay (EBAY) announced on Tuesday it would spin off the online payment platform PayPal, which it bought in 2002.  Meg Whitman, the CEO of HP, took the helm in 2011 and unveiled a five-year restructuring plan. That included a major overhaul of the printer and PC business in 2012. Layoffs then and since have totaled at least 45,000, and HP projected savings of $4.5 billion per year.  Related: Big companies that are making big job cuts  Her predecessor, Leo Apotheker, considered a corporate split similar to the one the Journal reported, but he left the company after only 11 months.  Whitman would have leadership roles at both companies, the Journal said. She would be CEO of the enterprise business and chairman of the hardware company.  Some investors applauded the potential move.  The split would allow HP to be more ""nimble"" and let it ""reshape"" its business, said Brendan Connaughton, chief investment officer at ClearPath Capital Partners.  In particular, Connaughton said, the move would put renewed focus on enterprise services, ""where they have incredible margins,"" sometimes upwards of 20%.  HP is among the top five performers in CNNMoney's Tech 30 index, which tracks significant tech companies. Its stock has climbed nearly 26% this year, bolstered by earnings that have climbed even as sales slumped.  --CNN's Paul LaMonica and Dave Goldman contributed to this report

1493,Cops Bought Dylann Roof Burger King Hours After Charleston Shooting,"The man accused of gunning down nine people inside a historic black church in South Carolina was ""polite"" and ""quiet"" while he was in police custody in North Carolina, according to a police chief who spoke with the Charlotte Observer.Dylann Roof, 21, was apprehended by Shelby police on Thursday. He has been charged with nine counts of murder in a mass shooting inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, last Wednesday.Police arrested him without incident. Shelby Police Chief Jeff Ledford told the Charlotte Observer that when Roof complained he was hungry, cops went to a nearby Burger King and bought the accused mass murderer a meal while he was in custody.

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton)""He was very quiet, very calm. He didn’t talk,” Ledford said. “He sat down here very quietly. He was not problematic.”Over the weekend, a racist manifesto purportedly written by Roof surfaced on a site that law enforcement sources told the Washington Post belonged to the 21-year-old.""I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight,"" the manifesto said. ""I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.""Roof is being held without bond.

		Obama collecting personal data for a secret race database	","
Submit 



		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	A key part of President Obama’s legacy will be the fed’s unprecedented collection of sensitive data on Americans by race. The government is prying into our most personal information at the most local levels, all for the purpose of “racial and economic justice.”Unbeknown to most Americans, Obama’s racial bean counters are furiously mining data on their health, home loans, credit cards, places of work, neighborhoods, even how their kids are disciplined in school — all to document “inequalities” between minorities and whites.This Orwellian-style stockpile of statistics includes a vast and permanent network of discrimination databases, which Obama already is using to make “disparate impact” cases against: banks that don’t make enough prime loans to minorities; schools that suspend too many blacks; cities that don’t offer enough Section 8 and other low-income housing for minorities; and employers who turn down African-Americans for jobs due to criminal backgrounds.Big Brother Barack wants the databases operational before he leaves office, and much of the data in them will be posted online. So civil-rights attorneys and urban activist groups will be able to exploit them to show patterns of “racial disparities” and “segregation,” even if no other evidence of discrimination exists.Obama is presiding over the largest consolidation of personal data in US history.The granddaddy of them all is the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing database, which the Department of Housing and Urban Development rolled out earlier this month to racially balance the nation, ZIP code by ZIP code. It will map every US neighborhood by four racial groups — white, Asian, black or African-American, and Hispanic/Latino — and publish “geospatial data” pinpointing racial imbalances.The agency proposes using nonwhite populations of 50% or higher as the threshold for classifying segregated areas.Federally funded cities deemed overly segregated will be pressured to change their zoning laws to allow construction of more subsidized housing in affluent areas in the suburbs, and relocate inner-city minorities to those predominantly white areas. HUD’s maps, which use dots to show the racial distribution or density in residential areas, will be used to select affordable-housing sites.HUD plans to drill down to an even more granular level, detailing the proximity of black residents to transportation sites, good schools, parks and even supermarkets. If the agency’s social engineers rule the distance between blacks and these suburban “amenities” is too far, municipalities must find ways to close the gap or forfeit federal grant money and face possible lawsuits for housing discrimination.Civil-rights groups will have access to the agency’s sophisticated mapping software, and will participate in city plans to re-engineer neighborhoods under new community outreach requirements.“By opening this data to everybody, everyone in a community can weigh in,” Obama said. “If you want affordable housing nearby, now you’ll have the data you need to make your case.”Meanwhile, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, headed by former Congressional Black Caucus leader Mel Watt, is building its own database for racially balancing home loans. The so-called National Mortgage Database Project will compile 16 years of lending data, broken down by race, and hold everything from individual credit scores and employment records.Mortgage contracts won’t be the only financial records vacuumed up by the database. According to federal documents, the repository will include “all credit lines,” from credit cards to student loans to car loans — anything reported to credit bureaus. This is even more information than the IRS collects.The FHFA will also pry into your personal assets and debts and whether you have any bankruptcies. The agency even wants to know the square footage and lot size of your home, as well as your interest rate.FHFA will share the info with Obama’s brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which acts more like a civil-rights agency, aggressively investigating lenders for racial bias.The FHFA has offered no clear explanation as to why the government wants to sweep up so much sensitive information on Americans, other than stating it’s for “research” and “policymaking.”However, CFPB Director Richard Cordray was more forthcoming, explaining in a recent talk to the radical California-based Greenlining Institute: “We will be better able to identify possible discriminatory lending patterns.”CFPB is separately amassing a database to monitor ordinary citizens’ credit-card transactions. It hopes to vacuum up some 900 million credit-card accounts — all sorted by race — representing roughly 85% of the US credit-card market. Why? To sniff out “disparities” in interest rates, charge-offs and collections.CFPB also just finalized a rule requiring all regulated banks to report data on minority hiring to an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion. It will collect reams of employment data, broken down by race, to police diversity on Wall Street as part of yet another fishing expedition.Through its mandatory Civil Rights Data Collection project, the Education Department is gathering information on student suspensions and expulsions, by race, from every public school district in the country. Districts that show disparities in discipline will be targeted for reform.Those that don’t comply will be punished. Several already have been forced to revise their discipline policies, which has led to violent disruptions in classrooms.Obama’s educrats want to know how many blacks versus whites are enrolled in gifted-and-talented and advanced placement classes.Schools that show blacks and Latinos under-enrolled in such curricula, to an undefined “statistically significant degree,” could open themselves up to investigation and lawsuits by the department’s Civil Rights Office.Count on a flood of private lawsuits to piggyback federal discrimination claims, as civil-rights lawyers use the new federal discipline data in their legal strategies against the supposedly racist US school system.Even if no one has complained about discrimination, even if there is no other evidence of racism, the numbers themselves will “prove” that things are unfair.Such databases have never before existed. Obama is presiding over the largest consolidation of personal data in US history. He is creating a diversity police state where government race cops and civil-rights lawyers will micromanage demographic outcomes in virtually every aspect of society.The first black president, quite brilliantly, has built a quasi-reparations infrastructure perpetually fed by racial data that will outlast his administration.Paul Sperry is a Hoover Institution media fellow and author of “The Great American Bank Robbery,” which exposes the racial politics behind the mortgage bust.Share Selection",161137,5389,14351,6635,583,5978,"0"

1506,Five Things 'Back To The Future Part II' Got Right About 2015 Technology,"In 'Back to the Future Part II,' Marty and Doc's time travel made many accurate assumptions about... [+] 2015. (Photo credit: Universal Pictures)In 1989's Back to the Future Part II, Marty McFly (Michael J. 
 
Fox
) travels to October 21, 2015, to save the fortunes of his future children. The time-traveling cinematic sequel made many assumptions about the world we live in today--and some of them were spot on.""I always hated--and I still don't like--movies about the future,"" director Robert Zemeckis writes in a new book, ""Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History."" ""I just think they're impossible, and somebody's always keeping score.""Indeed we are. Adobe's Digital Index (ADI) team, which tracks social listening, has been monitoring sentiments around technology mentioned in Back to the Future Part II to see whether the film's tech stood the test of time.""We wanted to create a digital scorecard looking at the predictions they made compared to where we are now,"" said Joe Martin, analyst with Adobe Digital Index. ""This is based off 100 million social engagements related to Back to the Future and technology.""When Back to the Future Part II premiered 26 years ago, it grossed $332 million worldwide and helped propel the trilogy to nearly a billion dollars in box office receipts. These are the five most accurate predictions from Doc Brown and Marty's decade-jumping DeLorean adventures:1. Wearable TechAfter Marty and Doc first land their DeLorean time-traveling car in 2015, Doc glances at his watch when Marty points out that it's raining. Doc says, “Wait five more seconds,” after which the rain stops. Doc's watch-based premonition suggests screenwriter Bob Gale was anticipating the invention of wearable tech such as the 
 
Apple
 Watch back when Apple had only just introduced the original Macbook. ADI looked at social media mentions and found that the Apple Watch, FitBit and 
 
Google
 onHub have had the most social buzz in the past 60 days. We also feel pretty good about them: average sentiment for those devices is 60% joy, admiration, or anticipation.2. VideoconferencingIn Back to the Future Part II, Marty talks to his former high-school classmate and work colleague, Needles, via videoconferencing software on a flat-screen smart TV. Gale and Zemeckis may have hit on the genesis of Skype, which was bought for $8.5 billion in 2011. Skype is now used worldwide, earning 7 million social mentions since June with the U.S., U.K., France, Brazil and Spain talking most about Skype on social media.3. Mobile PaymentsAs Marty walks through a town square, a man comes up to him with a tablet-like device and asks if he'll donate to save the clock tower. The implied payment through the tablet foreshadows our mobile-first society and far predates technology such as Square, PayPal or Venmo. ADI showed in quarter two of 2015 tablets produced 11% of visits and revenue to U.S. retail sites alone. ""23% of purchases on smart phones are using alternate payments methods,” Martin confirms.Back To The Future II's Missing Scene: 5 Things That Would Surprise Marty About Vaccines In 20154. Virtual RealityRemember the scene where Marty and his sister are wearing virtual reality (VR) glasses and they're using them to answer the phone while watching TV? We may be a ways off from such ubiquitous domestic integration of VR, but with the impending release of Oculus Rift's consumer-targeted headset the future as predicted in the film could arrive sooner than we might think. The public is certainly excited: When looking at social mentions, Facebook’s Oculus VR has the most buzz in 2015's third quarter, while 47% of the chatter relates to joy, admiration and anticipation.5. DronesBack to the Future Part II featured drone-like technology that was used widely by news outlets including a USA Today drone that's videotaping Doc. While media companies may be toying with using drones, they aren't yet commonplace in the newsroom arsenal. Still, drones are widely talked about today, with about 3 million mentions since June. Most of the talk relates to military use, and 60% of the buzz is negative.Technological Self-Fulfilling Prophecies From 'Back To The Future'Though Marty and Doc got many things right--including our obsession with hoverboards--there are several things the future surprised us with. Among the gadgets Gale failed to predict: the smartphone.""It's the Swiss Army Knife of today,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter. ""The fact that everyone can have one device that's a computer, that's a camera, that's a recording device, that's a calculator, that's a flashlight ... we didn't think of that.""The filmmakers also overplayed the importance of fax machines--a messaging system we have long since replaced with email. With 80% of millennials checking email on their smartphone, their future has no time for the clunky fax machine.WATCH: Talking Hoverboards With The Guy Who Dreamed Them UpI'm an associate editor at Forbes covering media and entertainment, with a focus on the movie business.

However, in this frame the crow did not seem to harass the bald eagle at such close proximity and neither did the bald eagle seem to mind the crow’s presence invading its personal space. What made it even more bizarre was that the crow even made a brief stop on the back of the eagle as if it was taking a free scenic ride and the eagle simply obliged.”As strange as this photo may be, it’s not the first time that such a rare and unexpected sight has been spotted by a photographer – check out the baby weasel that took a ride on this woodpecker!More info: 500px | Twitter | Flickr                                   Anyone can write on Bored Panda.

1519,Police Chief Says Dylann Roof Was Taken to Burger King Shortly After Arrest,"An almost unbelievable outtake from Shelby police chief’s description of a fateful dayLate on the evening of Wednesday, June 17, a 21-year old man, Dylann Roof, sat in a prayer group with several people at Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina. An hour later, he would kill 9 of them with a handgun, because he wanted “to kill black people.” Emanuel AME is a historic, African-American icon of a church in a town with a rich Black history.Just over 12 hours later, on Thursday morning, Roof was captured while on the run in North Carolina after authorities pulled over a Hyundai sedan which the murderous youth had apparently piloted out of town. The FBI quickly stepped in and handled Roof’s questioning after his swift arrest, but prior to that, during transport, his handling by the police was particularly peculiar. According to the account Shelby police chief Jeff Ledford gave the Charlotte Observer, Roof complained of hunger, and was treated to a meal at Burger King.Earlier in the day, Roof had bought water and chips at a south Charlotte gas station. Now he was hungry. Police bought him food from a nearby Burger King, Ledford said.After slaughtering 9 people in a church, Roof was arrested, strapped with a protective bulletproof vest, then treated to burgers and fries.If only these cops had handled Freddie Gray.

1545,"Before Pope Francis Met Kim Davis, He Met With Gay Ex-Student","AdvertisementSupported bytranscriptN/ABy Jim Yardley and Laurie GoodsteinVATICAN CITY — Ever since it became public that Pope Francis met in Washington with Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses for same-sex couples, the questions have been swirling: Why did he meet with her, and was it meant as a political statement?As it turns out, the Vatican said on Friday, the pope did not mean to endorse Ms. Davis’s views. It also said he gave her no more than a typical brief greeting, despite what her lawyer described.Instead, the Vatican said that Francis gave only one “real audience”: to someone later identified as one of his former students, Yayo Grassi, a gay man in Washington who says he brought his partner of 19 years to the Vatican’s embassy in Washington for a reunion. They even shot video.The disclosure, after the Vatican’s unusual attempt to correct the impressions left by Francis’ meeting with Ms. Davis, added to days of speculation about whether Francis intended to send a message on the place of gays in the church, or conscientious objection, and whether his advisers had fully briefed him on Ms. Davis, or had their own agenda.The Vatican spokesman emphasized that the meeting with Ms. Davis was arranged by the office of the Vatican’s ambassador in Washington, not by anyone in Rome — including the pope.“The pope did not enter into the details of the situation of Mrs. Davis, and his meeting with her should not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects,” the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said in a statement released Friday morning.On the other hand, Mr. Grassi, a 67-year-old caterer, told The New York Times that he and the pontiff have known each other since the 1960s, when Jorge Mario Bergoglio, as the future pope was then called, taught him literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción, a Jesuit high school in Santa Fe, Argentina.Mr. Grassi said that he had resumed contact with the future pope years later, when he was the archbishop of Buenos Aires. He also visited the pope at the Vatican in September 2013, and later contacted his office to ask for an audience in Washington.“Once I saw how busy and exhausting his schedule was in D.C., I wrote back to him saying perhaps it would be better to meet some other time,” Mr. Grassi said. “Then he called me on the phone and he told me that he would love to give me a hug in Washington.”Mr. Grassi said that he had been accompanied by his partner of 19 years, Iwan Bagus, as well as four friends, and that the meeting took place at the Vatican Embassy on Sept. 23 — a day before Ms. Davis met the pope.Mr. Grassi said that Francis had told him to arrange the visit through the office of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the papal nuncio, or envoy, in Washington.“It was a private meeting, for about 15 to 20 minutes, in which I brought my boyfriend of 19 years,” Mr. Grassi said. His boyfriend, Mr. Bagus, worked on a video that was posted online that showed Francis hugging Mr. Grassi and the others.Mr. Grassi said the meeting was purely personal. “I don’t think he was trying to say anything in particular,” Mr. Grassi said. “He was just meeting with his ex-student and a very close friend of his.”Late on Friday, the Vatican confirmed the meeting. “Mr. Yayo Grassi, a former Argentine student of Pope Francis, who had already met other times in the past with the pope, asked to present his mother and several friends to the Pope during the Pope’s stay in Washington, D.C.,” Father Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said in a statement.“As noted in the past, the pope, as pastor, has maintained many personal relationships with people in a spirit of kindness, welcome and dialogue,” the statement added.Earlier on Friday, the Vatican said that Archbishop Viganò had arranged the pope’s meetings in Washington, including the one with Ms. Davis.The news of the meeting with Ms. Davis was disclosed late Tuesday night by Ms. Davis’s lawyer, Mathew D. Staver, at the same time it was reported on the website of Inside the Vatican, a conservative publication edited by an American who has covered the Vatican for years.For nearly eight hours, Vatican officials refused to confirm or deny that the meeting had occurred, before finally confirming it on Wednesday afternoon.For Francis, the timing of the Davis controversy is not ideal. Beginning Sunday the Vatican is staging a critical three-week meeting of bishops and laypeople to discuss whether to recommend changing their approach to contemporary issues related to the family, like gay couples, single parents or whether divorced and remarried Catholics who have not obtained annulments should be allowed to receive communion.That meeting, known as a synod, could become a showdown between liberals and conservatives. Francis has spent nearly two years trying to gradually build consensus and has repeatedly stated his desire for a more welcoming, merciful outreach — even as he has not signaled any willingness to change church doctrine.News of his meeting with Ms. Davis buoyed Christian conservatives, who had been dismayed that the pope, in his emphasis on the poor, barely mentioned issues like abortion and homosexuality during his visit to Washington, New York and Philadelphia. It also puzzled and angered more liberal observers.It also led observers of the Vatican to speculate about whether the encounter with Ms. Davis was a signal of support for her cause. Francis has emphasized that he strongly believes in conscientious objection as a human right, a position he reaffirmed on his plane ride home.On Friday, the Vatican appeared to be distancing itself from Ms. Davis’s camp. Father Lombardi’s statement said that the brief meeting “has continued to provoke comments and discussion,” and that he was providing clarification “in order to contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired.”The Vatican’s statement prompted reactions on both sides of the Atlantic.In a phone interview on Friday, Mr. Staver said the meeting had been called by the Vatican.“This was a private meeting initiated by the Vatican,” Mr. Staver said. “My contacts were Vatican officials in the United States. And I was informed the request came directly from the pontiff.”Mr. Staver said the request had come on Sept. 14, the day Ms. Davis returned to work after her release from jail. Ms. Davis and her husband were picked up at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in a tan van by private security guards who spoke Italian, he said. She had been instructed to change her hairstyle so she would not be identified.Mr. Staver said Ms. Davis was not among a large group of people meeting the pope. She saw no one else waiting to see the pope and no one else saw her. “Just think about it. If she was in a line, there is no way this could have been kept secret for five days,” he said.transcriptNABut at the Vatican on Friday, a spokesman, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, said the invitation had been extended by the nuncio’s office — not from Rome.“Who brought her in? The nuncio,” said Father Rosica, who is working with the Vatican’s media office in advance of a major meeting of bishops that begins this weekend. “The Nunciature was able to bring in donors, benefactors.”Father Rosica said of the controversy: “I would simply say: Her case is a very complex case. It’s got all kinds of intricacies. Was there an opportunity to brief the pope on this beforehand? I don’t think so. A list is given — these are the people you are going to meet.”Mr. Staver, for his part, said he had been briefly introduced to Archbishop Viganò in April, when he spoke at a large rally in Washington against same-sex marriage, before the Supreme Court ruled on the issue.The Rev. James Martin, editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America, had cautioned in an article this week that the pope meets many well-wishers on his trips, and that news of the meeting with Ms. Davis had been manipulated.“I was very disappointed to see the pope having been used that way, and that his willingness to be friendly to someone was turned against him,” Father Martin said in an interview on Friday. “What may originally have prevented them from issuing a statement was the desire not to give this story too much air. But what they eventually came to realize was that they needed to correct some gross misrepresentations of what had happened. It shows that Pope Francis met with many people on the trip, and that she was simply another person who he tried to be kind to.”Father Rosica’s statement seemed to square with that account.Asked on Friday if the Vatican press office had been unaware that Ms. Davis had met the pope, Father Rosica said: “No, but I think we may not have been aware of the full impact of the meeting. It is very difficult sometimes when you are looking at things in America from here.”Over six days, the pope addressed Catholics and non-Catholics alike as he pleaded for environmental stewardship and compassion for immigrants and the poor in the halls of power.A receptionist who answered the phone at the Vatican Embassy in Washington on Friday said, “The nuncio does not deny that the meeting took place, but would not make any further comment.”She said the embassy did not have its own spokesman, and that no other officials there would comment.Archbishop Viganò is turning 75 in January, the age at which bishops must submit a formal request to the Vatican asking for permission to resign. These requests are not automatically accepted, and bishops often stay in their appointments well past age 75. But if Archbishop Viganò is held responsible for what is seen as a grave misstep on an important papal trip, he is likely to be removed at the first respectable opportunity, according to several church analysts.“Nobody in the Catholic Church wants another Regensburg,” said Massimo Faggioli, an associate professor of theology and director of the Institute for Catholicism and Citizenship at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. He was referring to the backlash after Pope Benedict XVI, Francis’ predecessor, gave a speech in Regensburg, Germany, that appeared to denigrate Islam.“This was not as serious as Regensburg, when Benedict read his own speech,” Dr. Faggioli said about the meeting attended by Ms. Davis. “But the pope has to be able to rely on his own system, and in this case the system failed him. The question is, was it a mistake, or was it done with full knowledge of how toxic she was?”The meeting with Ms. Davis was clearly a misstep, Dr. Faggioli said, “because the whole trip to the United States he very carefully didn’t want to give the impression that he was being politicized by any side.”He added, “And this thing is the most politicized thing that you can imagine.”Advertisement",50408990,846,202543,1935,146,8879,"1"

Manage NewslettersAmerica, on Afghanistan, lost moral standingNext time you vote for a president, vote as if the lives of our soldiers depend on itIn search of an American president: Biden clearly not fit for the jobUPDATE:A story in Thursday’s Washington Times saying that Joaquin Guzman, the Mexican fugitive drug trafficker known as “El Chapo,” threatened the leader of the Islamic State, is apparently a hoax that was originally picked up by a site that reports on cartel news.ThugLifeVideos.com told the Daily Mail and Snopes.com that Steve Charnock and his boss thought up the satire and wrote it on Nov. 30. The story on ThugLifeVideos.com wasn’t labeled as a satire on Thursday, and the site’s “About” section claimed it runs “more serious content” with the “odd satire stories.” On Friday, the story carried the satire label.TOP STORIES

ThugLifeVideos confirmed to The Times on Friday that it was a hoax.“We work in a massive viral network of websites that writes entertainment stories, sometimes we will have the odd satire post,” Jacob Willis from ThugLifeVideos told The Times in an email. “We fully intend for them to go viral, but not make it into mainstream media, that’s why we reached out to the Daily mail [sic] to set the story straight.”Apparently, cartelblog.com, which reports on the Mexican drug cartels, initially wrote about an email sent from Guzman to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terror group, saying: “Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation.”Cartelblog.com attributed its information to a Mexican blogger with “intimate ties with actual Sinaloa cartel members …”Rusty Payne, a DEA spokesperson, told Forbes on Thursday via e-mail: “I don’t have any information to weigh in either way.”The hoax was reported by The Times and other national publications.The Times has reached out to cartelblog.com without answer. Since Guzman is a missing fugitive drug kingpin, The Times could not call him directly to confirm the information in the original cartelblog.com post.ORIGINAL TEXT:Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the fugitive Mexican drug trafficker, reportedly issued a threat in an encrypted email to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terror group, saying: “Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation.”Apparently, one of the drug kingpin’s shipments was destroyed by the Islamic State, the U.K. Mirror reported Thursday.“My men will destroy you. The world is not yours to dictate. I pity the next son of a whore that tries to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa Cartel. I will have their heart and tongue torn from them,” Guzman said in an email, cartelblog.com reported.Guzman has been a fugitive since he dug his way out of a Mexican maximum security prison and fled in an underground tunnel on July 11. This was his second escape. In 2001, he had escaped another maximum security prison in Mexico, but he was later recaptured in 2014.Mexican officials said they thought Guzman had injured his leg and face during the latest escape through the tunnel.

		1.15 Million Americans Have Been Killed by Guns Since John Lennon’s Death	","
			Welcome,		Lennon was shot to death by Mark David Chapman 35 years ago TuesdayPolitics Staff Writer
				John Lennon was shot and killed 35 years ago Tuesday.			
				Rowland Scherman/Getty			It was shortly before 11 p.m. on December 8th, 1980, when 25-year-old Mark David Chapman fired five shots from a .38 caliber revolver into John Lennon’s back. Police officers rushed Lennon to Manhattan’s Roosevelt Hospital, 12 blocks away, in the back of a police cruiser. Hundreds of mourners gathered in the courtyard at West 59th Street and Ninth Avenue, holding vigil as they waited for a doctor to deliver news of his condition.The scene that unfolded that night has repeated itself — with minor variations for time, location and number of victims — over and over again in the 35 years since, most recently outside a pair of hospitals in San Bernardino, California.

Some 1.15 million people have been killed by firearms in the United States since Lennon was gunned down, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed by New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. (The figure includes estimates for the two most recent years.) 








Since 1968 — the year the Beatles released the White Album — more Americans have been killed by gun violence than in all U.S. wars throughout history, combined.Hillary Clinton was in Florida last week, giving a speech citing the staggering statistics about American gun violence, as the San Bernardino shooting was taking place. “Ninety Americans a day die from gun violence, homicide, suicides, tragic avoidable accidents — 33,000 Americans a year die,” Clinton told the crowd. “It is time for us to say we are going to have comprehensive background checks, we are gonna close the gun show loopholes.”In an address delivered from the Oval Office Sunday evening, President Obama urged Congress to consider a proposal to ban gun sales to individuals on the government’s no-fly list, and called for limits on assault weapons. Both proposals are supported by all three Democratic presidential candidates, and opposed by the majority of the Republican field.Republican candidates Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz voted against measures that would expand background checks and prevent terror suspects on the no-fly list from acquiring guns the day after the San Bernardino shootings; those candidates have received thousands of dollars from gun rights groups this election cycle.Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio spoke out against the measures, citing the unreliability of the no-fly list. Ohio Gov. John Kasich was the lone Republican candidate to express support for the proposed rule. “Of course, it makes common sense to say that, if you’re on a terrorist watch list, you shouldn’t be able to go out and get a gun,” Kasich said.Earlier this year, Obama gave one of his strongest speeches yet on the broader issue of gun violence in America, in the wake of the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Gun violence is “a political choice we make,” the president said, noting that “we, collectively, are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.”As of early December, there had been 353 mass shootings in 2015 so far — more mass shootings than there had been days in the year.Lennon’s widow, Yoko Ono, took to Twitter Tuesday to call for an end to gun violence.Over 1,100,000 people killed by guns in the USA since @JohnLennon was shot and killed on Dec 8 1980 #StopGunViolence pic.twitter.com/BUbGXqHbGN— Yoko Ono (@yokoono) December 8, 2015

1574,Paris Cop Fatally Shot as France Mourns Charlie Hebdo Massacre Victims,"SectionsTVFeaturedMore from NBC Follow NBC News PARIS — The fatal shooting of a female police officer in Paris was being investigated by counter-terror police Thursday but there was no firm link to the earlier execution of 12 people at a satirical magazine.The shooting occurred in southwestern suburb of Montrouge at about 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET). French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters at the scene that two officers had been shot and the suspect was ""still at large.""France was marking a day of mourning as the massive manhunt continued for two heavily-armed brothers suspected of carrying out Wednesday's massacre at Charlie Hebdo.Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that several people had been arrested since Wednesday's attack. Christophe Crepin of the UNSA police union said the arrests followed a raid on an apartment in Reims and that those held were connected to the suspects.Montrouge mayor Pierre Brossollette told The Associated Press that the officer slain on Thursday and a colleague went to the site to deal with a traffic accident. A car stopped and a man got out and shot at them before fleeing.""I heard a gunshot but I thought it was construction,"" nearby resident Linda Pluchon, 45, told NBC News. ""This shows it can happen anywhere. It happened next to us. We always think it will happen somewhere else.""Huge police (and media) presence in Montrouge following shooting of 2 cops http://t.co/H85GgAIYd5 FULL STORY: http://t.co/xzGgxqQqaQ #parisSylvie Perrot, 44, ran to the window of her apartment after hearing two or three shots. ""I heard someone shout ‘Get help!’,” she said. “I saw two people who were flattening themselves against a wall … and then my neighbor told me not to go outside.""Agnes Thibeaud, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, confirmed the female officer's death and said there was no direct link to the Charlie Hebdo massacre. The condition of the other victim was unclear.In a later announcement, the prosecutor's office said the investigation had been assigned to a counter-terrorist unit ""given the current context"" and because the heavily-armed perpetrator appeared to have ""deliberately targeted security forces.""Wednesday’s atrocity at Charlie Hebdo prompted condemnation and protests around the world.Police issued an appeal for sightings of Cherif Kouachi, 32, and his brother, Said, 34, warning that the pair should be considered ""armed and dangerous.” Cherif Kouachi served 18 months in prison on a charge of criminal association related to a terrorist enterprise after being convicted in 2008. He was part of an Islamist cell enlisting French nationals from a mosque in eastern Paris to go to Iraq to fight Americans in Iraq and arrested before leaving for Iraq himself.A third suspect, 18-year-old Mourad Hamyd, surrendered at a police station in Charlieville-Mezieres, near the eastern border with Belgium.Valls attended a crisis meeting in Paris Thursday morning. He said the suspects were likely to have been under the watch of authorities.""We are facing an terrorist threat that is without precedent,” he told French radio station RTL, saying police had foiled many other planned attacks but there was “no such thing as a zero risk” from terror.Despite the shootings, it was business as usual on the streets of Paris on Thursday as commuters calmly headed to work hours after thousands defiantly showed their solidarity with the 12 victims.A nationwide minute's silence was held at noon local time (6 a.m. ET) and President Francois Hollande attended a ceremony in memory of those slain.Hundreds stood in the rain outside Notre Dame cathedral in Paris to observe the silence. Even the capital's subway system paused to mark the moment, users said.Parisians gather under rain by Notre Dame to mourn #CharlieHebdo killings #Jesuischarlie pic.twitter.com/618DSKj5bVIn a show of unity, Hollande held a meeting with his political rival, ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, to discuss the national response to the attack.An explosion was also reported near a mosque in Villefranche-sur-Saône, France, early Thursday. ""I'm worried that this is tied to the dramatic events of Wednesday,"" Mayor Bernard Perrut told Le Progres.France raised its terror alert system to the maximum and bolstered security at media offices, places of worship, transport and other sensitive areas after Wednesday’s massacre..@afp Staff observe minute of silence at #AFP headquarters for the victims of #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie pic.twitter.com/noUJJiScxdThe attackers, wearing balaclavas, arrived at the building where Charlie Hebdo is based and killed a maintenance worker on the way in before heading to the third-floor editorial offices of the magazine. There, they shot dead eight journalists, a guest and a police officer who had been assigned to protect workers.""Hey! We avenged the Prophet Muhammad! We killed Charlie Hebdo,"" one of the men shouted in French, according to one video shot from a nearby building and broadcast on French TV.The attackers fled first in a black Citroen that they abandoned after a crash, and then in a sedan carjacked from a bystander.The Associated Press, Reuters and NBC News' Alexander Smith and David Wyllie contributed to this report.© 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",8606941,1842,151427,2047,51,1380,"1"

Your State Department funds are being well invested in one-way tickets for Syrian refugees to New Orleans, Louisiana. Former FBI Special Agent-In-Charge Jim Bernazzani gave his opinion on the matter. ""If I was in charge of ISIL, logistically I'd take advantage of this situation and put my people in, into the United States,"" he said. Governor Bobby Jindal expressed his concerns to the president by writing a letter to the executive office. ""As with former immigration crises and federal relocation policy, Louisiana has been kept in the dark about those seeking refuge in the state and it is irresponsible and severely disconcerting to place individuals, who may have ties to ISIS, in a state without the state's knowledge or involvement,"" he wrote.We're also increasing the number of Syrian and other refugees we admit to the U.S. to 100,000 per year for the next two years.With the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday, maybe we should rethink our strategy of bringing Syrians to America and decide whether or not it puts American lives at a risk.

With Love,

Anonymous— Operation KKK (@Operation_KKK) November 5, 2015Well, it’s finally here: the long-awaited list that Anonymous’s OpKKK has been collating for a year, since the first OpKKK which grew out of OpFerguson, which itself came into being over the apparently racially-based shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. The KKK decided to get involved, to “protect” the people of Ferguson, which is 67.4% African-American. Anonymous collectively got in their faces, literally in the case of videographer Alex Poucher, who invited Frank Ancona, Imperial Wizard of the Traditional American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, to a sit-down interview at a diner, frequently masked man to frequently masked man, masks off.That video has been viewed over 440,000 times.OpKKK was born on Friday, the 14th of November, 2014, in response to KKK flyers threatening protesters with “lethal violence.” As we reported at the time:The outcome was relatively predictable, as everynewsoutlet on the planet has alreadyreportedwhile I was offline. Anonymous took the KKK site offline, and doxed its members in and around the StLouis/Ferguson area via #, while simultaneously seizing control of a central KKK twitter account.Well, turned out that “KKK twitter account” was a false flag, and a highly effective one: it was a straw man fake KKK account set up by Anonymous, built up over time, and then, at the right moment, “seized” by Anonymous. Propaganda wars are so interesting, aren’t they?I chuckled :D #OpKKK pic.twitter.com/jGRPPe0vUG— t0p ಠ_ಠ (@t0p_100) November 20, 2014Anonymous also embarrassed several police officers by revealing their ties to the racist organization, Cabin Cr3w style.This year, what’s new? About 500 new names released, an embarassing KKK predeliction for the nearly-dead Google Plus social platform revealed, and the side-note of a very interesting list of members of the KKK who are also associated with the FBI. Whether that confluence is an expression of political support and exercise of the right of freedom of association, or for the purposes of surveillance and information, is as yet unclear.But since those names are now public, we might as well just, you know, Ask them.The official pastebin release (better download, it’s sure to be gone soon; the pastes from last year were removed promptly) has a lengthy introduction which discusses everything from the taxonomy of the KKK to the implications of one masked group outing another and how a Kantian ethical approach justifies OpKKK. Here’s a slightly edited (for length) excerpt of the most important parts of the intro.Where to Start? The basics. The Ku Klux Klan has approximately 150 active cells, operating in 41 states, with membership concentrated in both the South and the Midwest. At its peak, membership was in the millions. Now, membership is likely less than 5,000. It is very important to understand – the KKK does not have a central unified leadership. Instead, they are split off into local cells or groups.These groups generally oppose interracial relationships, homosexuality and illegal immigration and historically express this ideology through acts of terror. We want to remind you: This operation is not about the ideas of members of the Ku Klux Klan. This is about the behaviors of members of KKK splinter cells that bear the hallmarks of terrorism. When members of the KKK like Frazier Glenn Miller, (founder of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party) murdered three innocent individuals at a Jewish retirement home during Passover – the word “terrorism” was seldom found in mainstream media’s coverage of the attack. Why? What sort of violence does it take to call *some* factions of Ku Klux Klan what *some* of these cells really are?We defend free thought and free speech. The anons responsible for this operation will not support *acts* of terrorism and *acts* of hate inflicted upon the public. The KKK is part of an important cultural landscape and history in the United States. We need to make room for important, blunt, honest, public, productive conversation. Violent bigotry IS a problem in the United States. This is not a colorblind society. It deeply divided on racial lines.We hope Operation KKK will, in part, spark a bit of constructive dialogue about race, racism, racial terror and freedom of expression, across group lines.In this dox list, you will find official members of various KKK groups throughout the United States as well as their closest associates (most are also in other extremist hate groups). The klan sometimes hides behind several online identities. Given name or alias, these are the real people underneath the hoods.Data collected for Operation KKK was gathered over approximately 11 months and those included on this list were identified primarily through HUMINT (human intelligence) data collection strategies. This means that individuals on this list were often identified by human sources of information through both overt (interviewing expert sources) and covert (digital espionage / social engineering) methods. Individuals on our list were also identified through open source intelligence strategies (OSINT). This is a broad array of information and sources that are generally available to the public. This includes: multimedia, academic records and public data. Members often told on themselves to us about their connections with the KKK during various chat conversations we had with klan members and affiliates throughout the course of our operation. You never know who you are talking to on the internet.We understand this initiative is extremely controversial and we know we will face much criticism for this operation and our work will be heavily scrutinized. We hope this body of work speaks for itself. This is the OFFICIAL Operation KKK 2015 intel report associated with the @Operation_KKK Twitter account. The anons at @Operation_KKK are responsible for this specific liberation of information and we have done our best to ensure accuracy and avoid collateral damage to innocent parties. Erring on the side of caution, we removed several names from this list for further evaluation.We consider this data dump as a form of resistance against the violence and intimidation tactics leveraged against the public by various members of Ku Klux Klan groups throughout history.Big shoutout to some of the KKK FB accounts that gave us access to secret groups and other klan accounts for #OpKKK pic.twitter.com/NHjSEa6Tu5— Anon Cop Watch (@AnonCopWatch) November 5, 2015That’s the thing about social groups: once you’re in one, you’re introduced to the others. Start hanging around AnonOps, meet Cyberguerrilla, and on and on it goes.We removed several names from our list for further investigation. We would rather have a smaller, accurate list that we are comfortable with— Operation KKK (@Operation_KKK) November 5, 2015You can see on the paste itself the note that it has been edited: only the original poster, or someone with access to that account, can do that, so edits are deemed “official” in as much as anything can be official which originates with a faceless hive mind.A digression:Last year, the world (particularly the media world) eagerly awaited the release of the Anonymous dox of the officer who shot Michael Brown. At that time, a dox was released, quickly disavowed by the Anons working on OpFerguson, which incorrectly identified the police officer. The named subject had to go into hiding, but had nothing to do with Brown’s death. Media coverage of the dox and the fallout when it was found to be false, was massive.That “faildox” dissipated a significant amount of public faith in Anonymous, and stalled the media momentum for OpFerguson, which then had to spend almost as much energy apologizing and clarifying as it did researching.This year, a similar event occurred with OpKKK, and surprise, surprise, the same account is involved: then called TheAnonMessage, now known as TheAnonMessages, it remains, for some reason, a favourite with the mainstream media. It has been quoted in Business Insider on a Pirate Bay conspiracy theory, Huffington Post, Forbes, Time magazine (where this reporter was quoted refuting it), and many other outlets. It continues to be quoted despite the fact that as you can see from those links, many of those articles had to be amended afterwards when it turned out the information was false. Its reach is remarkable, moreso when considered against its record of faildoxing days before the real releases come out, repudiation by reputable Anonymous accounts whose operations have been thus pipped at the post, and failed singlehanded operations, as with its operation against Iggy Azalea.There was also his fake suicide, and the time he pretended ISIS had taken over his Twitter account.Please, media brethren and sistren, JUST STOP./digressionBack on-topic, this year there was even more chaos in the mix, as a lone hacker, Amped Attacks, released his own list of KKK members, independent of Anonymous and specifically refuting any link.i am not apart of anonymous nor have i ever claimed to be,i am my own man that acts on my own accord.i do however respect #OpKKK— Amped Attacks (@sgtbilko420) October 29, 2015https://t.co/Xch8siEAuD  KKK Associated People With Political Power… You Mad Bro?— Amped Attacks (@sgtbilko420) October 31, 2015His list was released on Halloween, contained the names of several prominent politicians, and has been strongly denied by those officials.

Also, nobody is simply mistaken that consistently, in that many different operations, in exactly the same media-grabbing way each time. If he had any legitimacy within Anonymous, his OpIceISIS would have taken off. Instead, he tweeted the hell out of it but it went nowhere, and Anonymous shunned him, creating OpISIS instead.LikeLikeFuck you you Jew bitches!

Our editorial content is not influenced by any commissions we receive.© Complex Media, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Complex.com is a part ofLauren is a writer living in New York City. Follow her at @LaurenNostro.Share This StoryUPDATE: Earlier today, we saw a news post on Dazed Digital—which they have since deleted—and aggregated from it, without checking the validity of yet another satire site. Thanks to Yesha Callahan, who pointed it out on Twitter, NewsWatch33 is a fake site and the news about Beyoncé and Jay Z buying rights to the Confederate Flag are not true. Beyoncé and Jay Z's lawyer confirmed earlier this week that the couple is trying to buy rights to the Confederate flag.Last month, photos of Dylann Roof—the terrorist who shot nine black people dead in a South Carolina church—emerged, in which he's pictured posing in front of the flag. The debate on the flag's use in the South reached a new peak following the Charleston Church Massacre. Recently, the South Carolina Senate voted to take down the flag, after major retailers—Walmart, Amazon, eBay, and Etsy, among others—began to pull Confederate merch from stores. Now, Bey and Jay want to purchase rights to the flag so it cannot be used on any merch in the future without their permission. “My clients are adamant about purchasing the rights to the Rebel Confederate flag,"" their lawyer Ralph Hammerstein told NewsWatch33.  They have expressed deep concern regarding the flag and how it is tearing apart our nation. Mr. and Mrs. Carter wants to assist in the abolishment of the flag by purchasing the resell rights to the Confederate flag. If my clients are successful, purchasing the rights would mean that anyone who wants to produce merchandise using the Confederate flag would have to get permission from Mr. and Mrs. Carter. My clients have expressed that they are not looking to profit from the use of the flag, but rather prevent any further use of the flag on merchandise.”[via Dazed Digital]Related StoriesSTORY CONTINUES BELOWJoin the conversation on Complex today!Share This Story",1452863,961,12589,830,163,10947,"0"

        Mayors flatly deny Klan membership after Anonymous releases names online
    
","All five mayors accused of being associated with the Ku Klux Klan by hacktivists affiliated with ""Anonymous"" have taken to social media to deny the charges.  ""I am opposed to everything the KKK stands for. I have no idea where this information came from, but wherever it came from, it is wrong,"" Lexington, Kentucky Mayor Jim Gray wrote on Twitter.This story has been updated. Please see below.On Monday morning, Anonymous began to release the names of 1,000 people who the group accuses of being members of the KKK. Other officials named in the document dump have begun to deny the charges including Mayor Paul Fraim, the Democratic mayor of Norfolk, Virginia. ""People have been spreading a report from the Internet that I am involved with the KKK. This report is a hoax and is absolutely false,"" Fraim said on Facebook.Mayor Madeline Rogero (D) of Knoxville, Tennessee also denied the allegations.""I’m not even sure this is worth responding to, but for the record: There is a list circulating online purporting to “out” elected officials as members of the KKK. For reasons unfathomable to me or anyone who knows me, my name is on the list. Given my background, my interracial family, my public record and my personal beliefs, this would be hilarious except that it is probably being seen by a lot of people who have no idea who I am,"" Rogero wrote on Facebook.""So, just to be clear, for anyone who doesn’t know me: Don’t be ridiculous,"" the mayor continued. ""I began my political career working for the rights of farm workers with Cesar Chavez. I have spent decades working for causes of social justice and equality. As Mayor, I have pushed for diversity in our workforce and outreach to and inclusion of people of all backgrounds in our community. In concert with President Obama’s My Brother’s Keeper program, I began the Save Our Sons initiative to increase opportunities and reduce violence-related deaths among boys and young men of color. I have advocated publicly for LGBT civil rights, and I was the only mayor in Tennessee to sign onto the mayors’ amicus brief for the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court’s marriage equality case. In short, I don’t think the KKK would want anything to do with me.""""I strongly request that anyone associated with the creation and dissemination of this false and defamatory accusation retract it immediately,"" Rogero wrote. ""It is irresponsible and slanderous. (Although, on a positive note, I do appreciate that they are using a picture of me from 12 years ago. Very flattering!)""Ocala, Florida Mayor Kent Guinn (R) told WKMG-TV reporter Erik Sandoval he wasn't a KKK member.Fort Wayne, Indiana Mayor Tom Henry denied the accusations as well. ""Claims that I have ties to the KKK are totally false and irresponsible,"" Henry wrote on Twitter. ""Our City celebrates and appreciates diversity and acceptance. Racism has no place in our society and my life.""Anonymous posted the names in a Pastebin account on Monday. Other politicians named by the group include Georgia Sen. Johnny Isaacson (R) and North Carolina's Sen. Thom Tillis, a Tea Party Republican. Twitter user Amped Attacks, who began attacking racist websites last month, took credit for posting the list, claiming he created it after hacking KKK websites. “I worked for nine days to gather and verify all the information that was gathered before its release,” Amped Attacks told TechCrunch. “I got the information from several KKK websites when I [hacked] them and was able to dump their database. I went through many emails that was signed up with these sites and a few of the emails that sparked my interest was the ones of the politicians in question there would be no reason for them to be signed up on any KKK website unless they supported it or was involved in it.”(Editor's note: This article was updated to include Tom Henry's statement. Also, Newsweek reported on Monday night that Anonymous has denied responsibility for the link published by a Twitter user identified as ""Amped Attacks."" The online activist group did, however, say it would release its own list of Klan members on Thursday.)House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has had a lot of political maneuvering to do this week. The California Republican has been vehemently critical of President Joe Biden's handling of the Afghanistan crisis — while carefully avoiding criticism of former President Donald Trump and glossing over the fact that Biden was essentially following the Trump/Mike Pompeo plan for withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan. And reporters are pointing out how badly McCarthy is contradicting himself and flailing around as he tries to articulate a coherent argument.At a news conference this week, McCarthy contemptuously said of Biden's administration, ""Why would you negotiate with the Taliban?"" But negotiating with the Taliban is exactly what Trump and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did in 2020. Pompeo met with Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, and Trump even talked about bringing the Taliban to Camp David.We've had quite an August. We got married, dodged a hurricane and came down with breakthrough COVID. While I would happily recommend the first two, I wouldn't wish the last on my worst enemy.This article first appeared in Salon.A former Navy SEAL who participated in a daring rescue of Afghan refugees earlier in the week under the name ""Pineapple Express"", cut off CNN host Michael Smerconish for questioning the loyalties of refugees who were extricated along with their families because they were U.S. allies during the occupation.According to ABC, ""Moving after nightfall in near-pitch black darkness and extremely dangerous conditions, the group said it worked unofficially in tandem with the United States military and U.S. embassy to move people, sometimes one person at a time, or in pairs, but rarely more than a small bunch, inside the wire of the U.S. military-controlled side of Hamid Karzai International Airport.,"" with the report adding that the group was made up of volunteers.Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

1629,"72 DHS Employees on Terrorist Watch List","ADVERTISEMENTSHAREAt least 72 employees at the Department of Homeland Security are listed on the U.S. terrorist watch list, according to a Democratic lawmaker.Rep. Stephen Lynch (D., Mass.) disclosed that a congressional investigation recently found that at least 72 people working at DHS also ""were on the terrorist watch list.""""Back in August, we did an investigation—the inspector general did—of the Department of Homeland Security, and they had 72 individuals that were on the terrorist watch list that were actually working at the Department of Homeland Security,"" Lynch told Boston Public Radio.""The [former DHS] director had to resign because of that,"" he said.DHS continues to fail inspections aimed at determining the efficiency of its internal safety mechanisms, as well as its efforts to protect the nation.Lynch referred to a recent report that found the Transportation Security Administration, which is overseen by DHS, failed to stop 95 percent of those who attempted to bring restricted items past airport security.""We had staffers go into eight different airports to test the department of homeland security screening process at major airports. They had a 95 percent failure rate,"" Lynch said. ""We had folks—this was a testing exercise, so we had folks going in there with guns on their ankles, and other weapons on their persons, and there was a 95 percent failure rate.""Lynch said he has ""very low confidence"" in DHS based on its many failures over the years. For this reason, he voted in favor of recent legislation that will tighten the vetting process for any Syrian refugees applying for asylum in the United States.""I have very low confidence based on empirical data that we’ve got on the Department of Homeland Security. I think we desperately need another set of eyeballs looking at the vetting process,"" he said. ""That’s vetting that’s being done at major airports where we have a stationary person coming through a facility, and we’re failing 95 percent of the time.""""I have even lower confidence that they can conduct the vetting process in places like Jordan, or Belize or on the Syrian border, or in Cairo, or Beirut in any better fashion, especially given the huge volume of applicants we’ve had seeking refugee status,"" Lynch said.Published under:

1636,Desperate Cruz Claims Planned Parenthood Shooter Was ‘Transgender Leftist’ Based On Rumor He Read,"Who is reading that crazy conspiracy theory meme your distant relative posted on Facebook? Ted Cruz apparently.In a move that reflected just how desperate the right-wing has become to call the Planned Parenthood terrorist attack about any but their own anti-abortion rhetoric, Republican presidential contender Ted Cruz floated the idea that the shooter was a “trangendered Leftist.”When asked – point blank – by a reporter whether he felt his party’s violent rhetoric about Planned Parenthood could have led to the shooting, Cruz did some of the most surreal spindoctoring in American political history. No, it was the “left” that was to blame for everything, he suggested.“Well I think there has been some vicious rhetoric on the left blaming those who are pro-life.” He later added: “This murder that occurred in Colorado is tragic, it is a criminal act we don’t fully know the motivations of this deranged individual, we know that he was a man who was registered to vote as a woman and the media promptly wants to blame him on the pro-life movement when at this point there is very little evidence to indicate that.”To be clear there is a LOT of evidence to indicate that the killer was inspired by the pro-life movement. For one thing, he took a high-powered rifle and walked into a Planned Parenthood full of innocent strangers and started shooting. For another, he literally told the police afterwards that he did it so there would be “no more baby parts.”Cruz wasn’t done demonstrating that he was grasping at straws. When the reporter noted all of the above evidence, Cruz went all-in with his “this was a transgender leftist” defense.“Well it is also reported that he was registered as an independent and as a woman and a transgendered leftist activist if thats what he is…um…I don’t think it is fair to blame on the rhetoric on the left this is a murderer.”Setting aside the fact that Cruz’s own brain seemed to shut down midway through that thought, his “reports” that the killer, identified as Robert Lewis Dear Jr., was a transgendered leftist are based on an internet rumor started by a conservative blogger named Jim Hoft who is known by many as the “dumbest man on the internet.” It’s a title he has repeatedly proved he deserves with an ever-growing series of baseless lies he writes from his right-wing conspiracy website. Ted Cruz is apparently Hoft’s biggest, and perhaps only, fan.Not pictured below: A “transgendered leftist activist.”Suspect confirmed as Robert L. Dear date of birth of 4/16/1958 pic.twitter.com/4v2GtIsUgT— Springs Police (@CSPDPIO) November 28, 2015The rumor about Dear’s sexual identity began because internet sleuths noticed that a voter registration card bearing his name listed his gender as “female.” Was it just a typo? Probably. But from that evidence alone, conservatives concluded that the person was transgender and also a leftist (?) and proceeded to run with it. The rumor was debunked almost immediately when acquaintances of Dear were tracked down and not one mentioned him being anything but a violent, disturbed man. Some did remember him being firmly anti-Obama though.Zigmond Post, who told BuzzFeed News he was a neighbor of Dear’s in Hartsel, said the man once gave him anti-Obama pamphlets.Post said he once went to Dear’s home to retrieve two dogs that had gotten loose. “We were there for a minute and the guy was already handing us anti-Obama pamphlets,” he said. According to Post, Dear said “Obama was ruining the country and needed to be impeached.”So we reach a very puzzling existential question: If Ted Cruz has no problem gobbling up everything the Dumbest Man on the Internet writes, is he therefore dumber than the Dumbest Man himself?I’ll leave you to ponder it.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",141691,59852,7521,5589,364,4082,"0"

                One of the five escaped hostages, believed to be Elly Chen, running towards police. - AFPPETALING JAYA: A female hostage, who was pictured making a striking escape from the Lindt cafe siege in Sydney, Australia, is a top university student and skilled sportswoman.Elly Chen, was one of two waitresses to run out from the cafe about 5pm (2pm Malaysia), just one hour after two customers and another staff member fled the premises.A Facebook community page saw well-wishers flooding a post, which detailed her daring bid for freedom, with exclamations of relief that she escaped unharmed.Netizen Melynda Smith lauded her bravery as it took guts and determination to flee from the clutches of an armed gunman, saying, ""My thoughts with you and everyone who has gone through such a frightening ordeal and for all to be released safely, big hugs.""According to her LinkedIn profile, Chen is an Actuarial and Finance student at the University of New South Wales, where she also volunteers as an environmental leader.As a national-level athlete, she also serves as a swimming and tennis instructor at her former alma mater, Sydney's Presbyterian Ladies' College.Despite her involvement in sports at a national and state level, Chen's studies did not suffer, having graduated from the institution with flying colours with an ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) of 99.25.

1692,Ben Carson is the most brainless brain surgeon in America says PIERS MORGAN,"By Piers Morgan for MailOnline  Published:  14:06 EDT, 7 October 2015   |  Updated:  18:52 EDT, 7 October 2015    517View  commentsDr Ben Carson is a brain surgeon.In fact, he’s one of America’s top neuro-surgical specialists; a man who made history when he became the first surgeon to successfully separate twins conjoined at the head.He specializes in pediatric neurosurgery. This is an area I’m familiar with because one of my cousins was a pediatric neurologist for many years at the world famous Great Ormond Street hospital in London.You don’t get to specialize in the medical science of children’s brains unless you’re incredibly skilled at your job.My cousin’s highly intelligent and has helped save many young lives.Dr Carson, I must therefore presume, is also highly intelligent and has also helped save many young lives.When Ben Carson first entered the political arena, I thought he might be a breath of fresh air: a black republican brain surgeon. It’s fair to say you don’t get too many of those to the dollar in Washington. But then he started speakingSo why does he persist in making public statements that make him sound like the most brainless berk in America?When he first entered the political arena, I thought he might be a breath of fresh air: a black republican brain surgeon.It’s fair to say you don’t get too many of those to the dollar in Washington.But then he started speaking.He compared homosexuals to bestiality and announced that being homosexual was ‘absolutely’ a choice, explaining: ‘A lot of people go into prison straight and when they come out, they’re gay.’He followed this by saying that Obamacare, a policy established to bring 30 million uninsured poor people into healthcare, was ‘the worst thing to happen to the nation since slavery’, adding: ‘And it is slavery in a way.’His next pronouncement was that America is now ‘very much like Nazi Germany’ and the Obama administration acts ‘like the Gestapo’.Yes, he compared this government to one that committed the Holocaust.More recently, he declared that no Muslim could ever become president, despite the U.S. constitution making it very clear that ‘no religious Test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust in the United States.’By now I was fairly convinced that Dr Carson was a nasty little bigot.What I didn’t expect him to be was stupid, or a man lacking in principle even if I didn’t agree with those principles.But then came the issue of guns.In 2013, Glenn Beck asked Dr Carson if people should be allowed to own semi-automatic weapons.He replied: ‘I think if you live in the midst of a lot of people and the semi-automatic weapon is going to fall into the hands of a crazy person, I would rather you not have it.’I cheered this sensible view from what seemed to be a very sensible man.But reaction from the hard-right gun lobby was fast and furious.Ben Carson really went crazy, telling ABC News that if he’d been confronted as the victims were in Oregon he’d have attacked the gunman and asked everyone else to as well. Pictured: Gunman Chris Harper-MercerConservative commentator Dana Loesch said ‘a lot’ of people like Dr Carson but ‘his belief of restriction of gun rights is a deal-killer’.The irony of course being that his call for a restriction of military assault rifles for civilians would actually stop less things being killed.Since the mass school shooting in Oregon, though, Dr Carson’s had a re-think about guns.Or more of a cowardly U-turn for pure political expediency.‘Guns don’t kill people,’ he told Fox & Friends yesterday, with a straight face.Later, he stopped by The View and said he’d like kindergarten teachers to be armed.Then, asked by Fox News if he’d go the scene of the Oregon shooting as President Obama is doing, he replied: ‘I would probably have so many things on my agenda that I’d go to the next one.’Finally, he went really bats**t crazy, telling ABC News that if he’d been confronted as the victims were in Oregon he’d have attacked the gunman and asked everyone else to as well.The clear message being that the students who died had somehow failed to show his kind of Rambo strength of character in their moment of horrendous terror.But victim-blaming wasn’t even Dr Carson’s most hideous statement on guns in the last 48 hours.In a Facebook posting on Monday night, he said this: ‘As a Doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies. There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking – but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.’WHAT? I’d love to take Dr Carson to Sandy Hook today and show him the photographs of those 20 slaughtered children. Each of their small bodies punctured by 3 to 11 bullets leaving holes the size of golf balls (I repeat this detail a lot, because I want people to know it and visualize it)One of America’s leading surgeons believes no bullet-ridden body of a fellow American can ever be worse than gun control measures designed to stop the shooting happening in the first place?I’d love to take Dr Carson to Sandy Hook today and show him the photographs of those 20 slaughtered children. Each of their small bodies punctured by 3 to 11 bullets leaving holes the size of golf balls (I repeat this detail a lot, because I want people to know it and visualize it).Then I want to hear him tell the parents of those kids that their annihilation wasn’t as devastating as him having to give up guns.He wouldn’t have the courage to say it to their faces, of course.In fact, Dr Carson seems a particularly gutless individual generally for one with such an eminent resumé.A man who loves to bill himself as a charming, respectable, humble, smart brain surgeon. But who in reality is an unpleasant, arrogant, sneering piece of work pandering to the very worst elements of the far-right GOP membership, and prepared to chop and change his views on a whim to secure their support.My neurologist cousin is a man of great kindness, sensitivity and genuine humility.The staggering thing about Dr Carson is that he can, by all accounts, show all these qualities in a surgery room.But when running for president he prefers to be casually vicious, prejudiced and callous.The most dangerous people in politics are often the most intelligent.They know best how to manipulate the masses, and to get what they want.An America run by Dr Carson would be a shameful place.One where intolerance is king and death is inconsequential.I hope he gets bounced out of this race very soon, before it’s too late.  Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group",7995551,1900,30671,2076,583,82857,"0"

Helen Davidson sends this round-up from the scene:More than 16 hours after it began, the siege at a cafe in Sydney’s Martin Place dramatically came to an end.Shortly after 2am a loud bang was heard coming from the building, followed by shouts from police and several people – including apparent hostages – running from the scene.A sustained mix of what appeared to gunfire and flashbangs went on for 10 to 15 seconds as police stormed the cafe. At the sound of a second bang, an officer in bomb disposal gear appeared and there was another short burst of the gunfire/flashbang.One injured female hostage was carried out by two police officers, and paramedics brought another three out on stretchers. Paramedics performed CPR on one.Police will not yet confirm fatalities or injuries but the NSW ambulance service has said they are ‘treating and transporting a number of hostages’.What they have confirmed is that the situation is over. The police commissioner will speak at 5am.The police presence has significantly lessened but roads remain closed. 

5.24pm GMT

My colleague Michael Safi sends this on the man identified in reports as the hostage-taker:The man behind the Sydney cafe siege is reported to be 49-year-old self-styled ‘Muslim cleric and peace activist’ named Man Haron Monis, who is currently on bail facing dozens of charges of indecent and sexual assault.Monis, who also goes by the names Mohammad Hassan Manteghi and Manteghi Boroujerdi, was infamously involved in sending ‘grossly offensive’ letters to parents and relatives of Australian victims of terrorism and troops killed in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2009. He unsuccessfully challenged the conviction in the high court last year.The Iranian-born man, who apparently converted from Shia Islam to Sunni only last week, has also been accused of being an accessory in the killing of his ex-wife, a charge for which he remains on bail.He told ABC News in 2001 that he fled Australia five years earlier after falling foul of the Iranian regime, which he said had placed his wife and children under house arrest. ‘I can say they are hostage,’ he said at the time.A fringe figure in Australia’s Muslim community, Monis has been spurned by Shia leaders, who have reportedly urged federal police to investigate the man over his claims to be an ayatollah, or Shia cleric.According to a post on his website, Monis converted to Sunni Islam in December, labelling Shia Muslims as ‘rejectionists’.A rambling October letter he penned to the Muslim community rejected the ‘new religion’ of moderate Islam. ‘This pen is my gun and these words are my bullets, I fight by these weapons against oppression to promote peace,’ he wrote.An image on the website appears to show Monis wearing the same headband that photographs suggest he donned during the Martin Place siege, reading: ‘We are ready to sacrifice for you, O Muhammad.’Shortly after the prime minister, Tony Abbott, was elected in September 2013, Monis sent a letter inviting him to a live debate where he said he would prove that ‘Australia and Australians will be attacked’ as a result of the country’s participation in the war in Afghanistan.

To catch up with events so far, take a look at this report by my colleague Peter Walker: Sydney siege ends as police storm Lindt Cafe and hostages run out.An armed siege at a cafe in the heart of Sydney has ended after police entered the building shortly after a series of loud bangs were heard and groups of hostages ran out onto the street.In dramatic scenes about 17 hours after a single armed man, named in reports as Man Haron Monis, first took an unknown number of hostages, heavily armed police stormed the Lindt Cafe, in a building on Martin Place, a pedestrianised street in the middle of Sydney’s central business district.Several bursts of gunfire could be heard, and several people were seen being carried from the building, apparently injured. Some reports said a police officer had been hurt. A number of paramedics were at the scene.The chaotic scenes began as between five and seven hostages were seen running from the cafe, the second group of captives to escape since the siege began at about 9.45am on Monday local time. Later, other groups of what appeared to be hostages could be seen running out.

3.53pm GMT
15:53

Police have confirmed that the siege is over but there has been no update on the status of the hostage-taker(s) or the hostages.We do know that several people were removed from the scene on stretchers.

3.49pm GMT

NSW Police say they cannot confirm breaking reports that two people have died in the Sydney siege, saying all they can confirm is that the siege is over.

1725,Texas Plumber Suing Dealership After ISIS Uses His Trade-In Truck,"Plumbing company's logo and phone number visible in ISIS photos.Texas Plumber Files Lawsuit After ISIS Uses Truck With His Logo— -- The Texas plumber who is suing AutoNation for $1 million says his family received death threats after a pickup truck he traded in with the car dealer ultimately ended up in the hands of ISIS fighters in Syria.Mark Oberholtzer says he traded in his black, Ford F-250 pickup truck at AutoNation Ford Gulf Freeway in Houston and was told the dealership would remove the decals of his company logo from the truck on their own to avoid scratching the truck’s paint.Months later, Oberholtzer says the truck began showing up in photographs posted on extremist Twitter feeds, with the logo and phone number of his Mark-1 Plumbing company still clearly visible.“My secretary called me and said, ‘You can’t believe this,’” Oberholtzer told ABC News.  “I really at first thought it was just somebody playing with us.”“She was getting constant calls, threats, nothing about plumbing,” the Texas City, Texas, plumber said of his secretary.The social media photos, which also began to pop up on Yelp, show the truck in action with ISIS militants firing an anti-aircraft gun with the Mark-1 Plumbing logo and company phone number clearly visible.Photos of the truck even made it into the final episode of “The Colbert Report” on Comedy Central.“A Texas plumber’s work truck showed up in Syria, although, pickup truck, desert, giant machine gun, that could still be Texas,” Colbert joked on the show.Using the website Carfax.com, the truck was tracked from an auction site in Houston to Mersin, Turkey and, finally, somewhere near Aleppo in Syria and in the hands of jihadists.Oberholtzer’s lawsuit against AutoNation, filed this month in Texas, seeks $1 million in damages, claiming “Mark-1’s revenues were lost and the company’s reputation … was irretrievably damaged.”“I don’t need this press and I don’t need the threats to my family,” said Oberholtzer, who was also questioned by FBI and Homeland Security officials after photos of his truck emerged online.AutoNation told ABC News the company set Oberholtzer’s truck out for auction as soon as it came in.“The truck came in on trade and was immediately sent to auction. The auctions in most accounts will prep the vehicles. We have the paperwork that shows the steps the vehicle took,"" AutoNation said in a statement.  ""It is unfortunate that the customer has had to go through this.”24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",16802461,507,178200,1544,374,16123,"0"

October 21, 2015 / 9:15 AM
          / CBS News
        October 21, 2015 marks an exciting day in cinematic history -- the future is finally here.In the sequel to the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel thirty years into the future, to this very date in their DeLorean time machine. In the real 20-teens, it's all about self-driving cars, but many of the film's other predictions for the future have finally become present,  reports Vladimir Duthiers of CBS News's digital network CBSN.Screenwriter Bob Gale had a clear vision for the future. Inside the Cooper Union Clock Tower, Gale told us he wanted 2015 to be recognizable. ""We knew going in nobody successfully predicts the future accurately, can't be done,"" said Gale. ""We want the future to be a positive, optimistic future. We want people to see this movie and say, 'Hey I like that future, I'd like to live there.'""  In the film, a gang chased Marty around town in 2015, each flying on their own personalized hoverboard. Visual effects art director John Bell designed many of the movie's futuristic elements, including hoverboards and the nostalgic Café 80s.  ""All we know is we go thirty years in the future and there's something called the hoverboard,"" said Bell. ""I'll take something that's 85 percent familiar -- it could be a shape, it could be a color, it could be a pattern -- and then if I'm projecting the future, throw something that's just a little 15 percent twist.""  Today, companies are still testing how to make a reliable, working hoverboard for the general public. On the real streets of 2015, toys like swagways are the closest we've gotten to gliding around. ""There were a lot of old predictions that we made where maybe that'll come true, that has a good chance. Hoverboards? We never thought that,"" said Gale. ""They say life imitates art...so kids like you saw ""Back to the Future part 2"" back in the day and said well, if I can't have a hoverboard...I'm going to make one.""Even the movie's fantasy about drones have made it to reality. ""They're being used by everybody, they're all over the place,"" said Bell. ""We started out thinking this was this gag technology, its just a joke. Little did we know people are using them all over the world.""We're not thinking about 'we're making it an important statement about the future here"" - No, no, no, no -- we're having a good time,"" said Gale. While nobody uses fax machines anymore for instant communication as in the movie, it nails other everyday technology--like finger print scanners, which unlock the front door and pay for things like taxis in the film. Today we use biometric technology to open doors, unlock smartphones and even authorize digital payments. The McFlys also use a giant flat screen TV that responds to audio commands and makes video calls. Flat screens have been around for a while now, but Samsung's Smart-TV now even has a voice recognition. As for video calls, there's Facetime and Skype. Duthiers spoke to Executive West Coast Editor of Vanity Fair, Krista Smith via Skype.""I think [the movie] still holds up, absolutely...the stuff that they were talking about in 85 to 90 is stuff that's actually a reality now,"" said Smith. ""As a teenager it's still very relevant...because you're still going through the same things. It doesn't matter if you have an iPhone or if you can fly around the world -- 15-year-olds are feeling the same thing 15-year-olds were feeling in the 50s.If we wait just a bit longer, we will see whether the movie's ultimate prediction will come true --  whether the Cubs will win the World Series, marking the first time in 107 years since the Cubs won their last World Series title. Three decades later, ""Back to the Future II"" still has a lasting impact and resonates with viewers, which Gale attributes to the ""humanity"" in the film.""The movie says you have some control over your own destiny, the things that you do today can have a life changing effect in your future...,"" says Gale. To celebrate the movies, a 30th anniversary DVD is out, and the trilogy is being re-released in select theaters nationwide.

1747,"Rupert Murdoch Takes Over National Geographic, Then Lays Off Award-Winning Staff","The memo went out, and November 3rd 2015 came to the National Geographic office. This was the day in which Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox took over National Geographic. The management of National Geographic sent out an email telling its staff, all of its staff, all to report to their headquarters, and wait by their phones. This pulled back every person who was in the field, every photographer, every reporter, even those on vacation had to show up on this fateful day.As these phones rang, one by one National Geographic let go the award-winning staff, and the venerable institution was no more.The name now belongs to Rupert Murdoch, and he has plans for it. The CEO of National Geographic Society, Greg Knell, tried to claim back in September that there “there won’t be an [editorial] turn in a direction that is different form the National Geographic heritage.” Murdoch’s move today only served to prove Knell’s words hollow, with hundreds of talented people now served their pink slips. And with the recognition that Murdoch’s other enterprises do not reflect the standards held by National Geographic, and with Murdoch’s history of changing the editorial direction of purchased properties, today’s move indicates that we can expect a similar shift for National Geographic.The National Geographic Society has long stood for science, research, and investigation. Murdoch’s companies have long stood against all three. The two positions would be in conflict, save Murdoch’s company is firmly in control. The editorial changes will therefore be severe, and erode the 127 years of publication excellence. For the men and women who brought National Geographic to worldwide prominence, the termination of employment is a tragic end both for hard-working people, and for National Geographic itself.Your email address will not be published.

1767,El Chapo Threatens ISIS,"Posted December 10, 2015UPDATE (12/11): Unfortunately, the story is a hoax. El Chapo is still very much free, though.El Chapo is no fan of GOP doofus Donald Trump but he has more pressing matters. Reportedly, the Mexican drug lord, who is still on the run after escaping from prison again, has threatened ISIS.Reports the Toronto Sun:Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the Sinaloa cartel boss and world’s most wanted drug lord, has threatened ISIS with retaliation if it continues to destroy his drug shipments to the Middle East that go through the terror group’s “caliphate.”And he’s not mincing words.“I pity the next son of a whore who tries to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa cartel. I will have their hearts and tongues torn from them,” El Chapo reportedly wrote ISIS in an e-mail leaked to a Mexican blogger with ties to the cartel.The encrypted e-mail, which hasn’t been verified, was sent directly to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to cartelblog.com.Apparently ISIS is against drugs—but killing innocent people is fair game.History has shown…don’t f*ck with El Chapo.—Photo: Mexico Attorney GeneralSign Up For The Hip-Hop Wired Newsletter

1786,"No, Mexican Drug Kingpin 'El Chapo' Did Not Threaten to Destroy ISIS 'P*ssies'","Update, December 11th: Well, we fell for a hoax. Writer and satirist Steve Charnock fed the story to CartelBlog.com as  ""a work of pure fiction"" before it was picked up by mainstream media outlets. A guy can dream, I guess.Original story: ISIS has no shortage of enemies: the U.S., France, the hacker collective known as Anonymous. And now the terrorist group can add one more to their list: Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the notorious Mexican drug kingpin who tunneled out of a prison near Mexico City in July.
	According to an email reportedly sent by Chapo and leaked to CartelBlog.com, an independent website documenting the activities of Mexican cartels in America's failed drug war, Chapo isn't targeting ISIS in revenge for the Paris attacks that left 130 dead in November. Instead, he's taking aim at the terrorist organization because ISIS militants destroyed a large shipment of drugs that entered the Middle East in the past few weeks.
	Here's what he alledgedly wrote:You [ISIS] are not soldiers. You are nothing but lowly pussies. Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation.My men will destroy you. The world is not yours to dictate. I pity the next son of a whore that tries to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa Cartel. I will have their heart and tongue torn from them.Obviously, this story is a little suspect given the sourcing. CartelBlog.com says the email was obtained when a Mexican blogger ""leaked the message after it was sent email encrypted directly to the Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, a prominent ISIS leader."" But considering that Mexican cartels are more violent and just as brutal as ISIS (and yes, that includes beheadings), would-be ISIS militants operating in Mexico should probably watch their backs.
	Chapo himself is wanted by Mexican and U.S. authorities, the latter of which has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. We'll be waiting to see if the legendary drug kingpin risks his own safety to strike back at the terrorist organization the whole world hates.h/t Toronto SunPhotos by Marco Ugarte / AP",501484,1950,7260,770,125,3008,"0"
1787,"ISIS planning attack on WWE event in Atlanta, Anonymous says "," ISIS may be planning to body slam the WWE. The FBI is investigating a mysterious threat claiming Islamic State terrorists will attack a Sunday World Wrestling Entertainment event in Atlanta. While agents are taking the alleged threat — forewarned by hacktivist group Anonymous — seriously, they do not ""have specific or credible information"" that the Philips Arena wrestling match is a target, the FBI said in a statement. ""We have, however, made the proper notifications as we continue to work closely with our law enforcement and private sector partners to keep our community safe,"" the statement read. Anonymous claimed it uncovered the veiled threat days after declaring cyber war on the terror network. Fighters are planning an assault on WWE's Survivor Series, Anonymous said in a statement. The wrestling event is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at Atlanta's Philips Arena. The wrestling match will go on, WWE officials said. ""WWE Survivor Series is currently scheduled as planned while we investigate the matter with federal, state and local authorities,"" WWE said in a statement. The Survivor Series, first held in 1987, is one of WWE's four original pay-per-view wrestling competitions. This year's event features seven face-offs including the Diva's Championship match and a tag team match that puts four wrestlers in the same ring. The Atlanta attack is just one of a slew of ISIS-led rampages allegedly set for Sunday. The terrorists also plotted out attacks at concerts, colleges and churches in Europe and Asia, Anonymous said. Possible terror targets include a Five Finger Death Punch heavy metal concert in Milan, Feast of Christ the King celebrations in Rome, University Pastoral Day at Lebanon's Holy Spirit University, an event at Al-Jihad mosque in Indonesia and two music shows in Paris. Anonymous provided no further details about the attacks. The hackers said they submitted proof of the plans to the appropriate authorities days ago. ""But because they have not done anything with it yet and it's almost the 22nd, we have taken matters into our hands,"" the group said in the statement, which served as a warning to anyone planning to attend one of the targeted events. Anonymous announced it was waging a cyber war against the terrorists last week after ISIS took responsibility for a wave of attacks that killed 130 people in Paris. ""Expect massive cyber-attacks,"" a voice said in a video announcing the planned hackings on ISIS. ""War is declared. Get prepared. Anonymous from all over the world will hunt you down.""",803807,830,10374,1688,130,1655,"0"

El Chapo, that guy whose life is so undeniably similar to the plot of the greatest AMC series you've never seen, is still running from those not keen on his most recent prison escape.Combining these two highly tweetable figures, of course, results in some obvious fireworks. As previously reported, El Chapo and his family are not huge fans of Trump's laughably stupid statement on so-called immigration reform. Trump, for reasons entirely clear, has taken this disliking quite personally, even going so far as to reportedly enlist the service of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. However, such efforts apparently haven't deterred the increasingly threatening tactics of El Chapo:Yes, according to TeleSurTV, El Chapo has increased the bounty on Trump's hair hat to a less-than-paltry $100 million. ""He was mad,"" a predictably unnamed source tells the publication. ""He wants Donald Trump dead and will pay any amount of money to have Donald Trump’s head.""Meanwhile, the entirety of American politics wishes desperately for Donald to quietly exit the 2016 race for the White House, an exit that would essentially be a gift to the nation too precious for a specific valuation.Related StoriesSTORY CONTINUES BELOWIn related news, maybe El Chapo owes South Park $100 million?Join the conversation on Complex today!Share This Story",2534892,765,3749,632,1290,134671,"0"

1820,The Economist explainsWhy America does not take in more Syrian refugees,"by V.v.B. | CHICAGOA daily email with the best of our journalismMORE THAN 12m Syrians have been forced from their homes by the civil war, according to the United Nations. Of those, more than 7.5m have been displaced within Syria, often to parts of the country that aid organisations cannot reach. More than 4m have fled abroad, mostly to neighbouring countries. Around 1.9m are in Turkey, 1.1m in Lebanon and 650,000 in Jordan. And hundreds of thousands have sought refuge in Europe. Having initially welcomed tens of thousands of newcomers, Germany is growing increasingly reluctant to take in more. By the end of the year it expects to have 1.5m asylum seekers, many of them Syrian. Meanwhile America—26 times larger, with a population four times the size of Germany's—has taken in only 1,500 Syrians since the start of the war. Why is this number so low?Under pressure from Germany and other allies, the White House recently promised to increase America’s total intake of refugees to 85,000 in the next fiscal year (10,000 will be from Syria) and to 100,000 in the one after that (see article). Even this very modest rise has been contested. Michael McCaul, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, introduced a bill to “rein in” the administration’s plan to admit more Syrian refugees. ""I can't support a policy that would allow a jihadist pipeline into the United States,"" the Texas Republican told Fox News, a conservative television channel.This is a stark expression of the reason America does not want to give refuge to more Syrians. In addition to concerns about the cost of resettling destitute newcomers who speak little English, America is deterred by fears of terrorism. Since the attacks on September 11th 2001 all immigrants and newcomers have been viewed through this lens, says Eva Millona at the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition. And the much more extensive vetting procedures of refugees introduced after those attacks are expensive. After refugees are referred by an American embassy or the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, they are screened by Department of State Resettlement Service Centers all over the world. They undergo multiple investigations of their biographies; biometric checks of their fingerprints and photographs; in-depth interviews by highly trained Department of Homeland Security officers; medical screenings as well as investigations by the National Counterterrorism Center and by intelligence agencies. The entire process can take longer than three years. If a potential terrorist is determined to enter America to do harm, there are easier and faster ways to get there than by going through the complex refugee resettlement process. Of the almost 750,000 refugees who have been admitted to America since 9/11, only two Iraqis have arrested on terrorist charges; they had not planned an attack in America, but aided al-Qaeda at home. Syrians in America have fared better than other groups of refugees, integrating quickly and finding work. Some have done very well indeed: the father of Steve Jobs, the ground-breaking innovator and founder of Apple, was a refugee from Syria. And the mother of Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian, is of Jewish Syrian descent.A daily email with the best of our journalismPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” Copyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2021.

Anonymous to reveal identities of 1,000 Ku Klux Klan members on 1st anniversary of Ferguson protests","Anonymous hacktivists are planning to reveal the identities of 1,000 members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) on the first anniversary of the Ferguson protests which erupted on 24 November 2014. Operation KKK, or #OpKKK, will also aim to shut down websites and other social media accounts affiliated with the KKK.The on-going battle between the KKK and Anonymous began during the protests in Ferguson which erupted in the wake of a grand jury decision to not indict police officer Darren Wilson for killing unarmed black teenager Mike Brown. During the protests a local chapter of the KKK – known as the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (TAKKKK) – warned protesters that ""lethal force"" would be used against them.In response to this threat, Anonymous took control of the KKK's main Twitter account and published personal information regarding some alleged members of the TAKKKK. The amorphous group also alleged that it had evidence of a connection between the Ferguson police department and the TAKKKK.We've gained access to yet another KKK Twitter account. Using the info obtained, we will be revealing about 1000 klan member identities.Following the Anonymous operation, several members of the KKK reportedly left the group after having their identities exposed. Ahead of the anniversary of the Ferguson protests, a faction of Anonymous has now threatened to reveal the identities of more KKK members.""We are not attacking you because of what you believe in as we fight for freedom of speech,"" Anonymous said in a statement released last week. ""We are attacking you because of what you do to our brothers and sisters.""Due to your actions we will be rearranging Operation KKK. We've gained access to yet another one of your KKK Twitter account. Using the info obtained, we will be revealing about 1000 of your klan member identities. The aim of the operation is nothing more than cyber Warfare. Anything you upload will be taken down, anything you use to promote the KKK will be shut down.""",126024,168,3619,2056,3383,27541,"0"

1898,"Judy Carne, ‘Sock It to Me’ Girl on ‘Laugh-In,’ Dies at 76","AdvertisementSupported byBy Bruce WeberJudy Carne, a sprightly British actress and comedian who rocketed to pop culture fame as the “sock it to me” girl on “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In,” a landmark of television zaniness, before her career was derailed by drug arrests and a near-fatal automobile accident, died on Thursday in Northampton, England. She was 76.The probable cause was pneumonia, said a friend, Jon Barrett, who said Ms. Carne had been in the hospital for several days and that the official death certificate was not yet available.After starting her career in England and building a résumé of appearances onstage, on television and in movies, Ms. Carne moved to the United States, where her first television role was as an exchange student in the sitcom “Fair Exchange.” She also became the first wife of a later-to-be movie star, Burt Reynolds.She made guest appearances on westerns including “Bonanza” and “Gunsmoke,” dramas like “12 O’Clock High” and comedies including “Gidget” and “The Patty Duke Show” before landing a starring role in a “Love on a Rooftop,” a romantic comedy set in San Francisco about a young woman from a wealthy family who has disappointed her father by marrying a struggling young architect played by Peter Deuel (later known as Pete Duel).Ms. Carne became widely known on “Laugh-In,” an ensemble comedy show composed of brief bits of slapstick antics and verbal nonsense tumbling over one another in furious succession. It ran on NBC from 1968 to 1973.Often racy in content — well, racy for the time — the show featured attractive women (Ms. Carne and Goldie Hawn among them) in miniskirts and other revealing costumes and jokes about sex, drugs and politics that tested network censors. It was enormously popular, in part because of Ms. Carne and the running gag that became a national meme.Slender but shapely, with a pixieish haircut and a gamely irrepressible manner, she would appear before the camera and declare, in one variation or another, “It’s sock-it-to-me time,” and she would be subsequently doused with water or she’d vanish through a trap door in the floor or have some other indignity visited on her.The phrase “sock it to me,” evidently seized by the show’s writers from a chant in Aretha Franklin’s recording of the Otis Redding song “Respect,” became cool, hip enough lingo that celebrity guests appeared on “Laugh-In” in cameo bits to utter it, including, most famously, Richard Nixon, less than two months before he was elected president in 1968.Ms. Carne was trained in dance and theater and reportedly took the name Judy at the suggestion of a teacher. The name Carne came from a character in a play by the English playwright Charlotte Hastings. She was born Joyce Audrey Botterill in Northampton on April 27, 1939. Her parents were greengrocers.Ms. Carne left “Laugh-In” in 1970. The sock-it-to-me label had become trying to live with, she said; people would douse her with water on the street.Not sure what to stream anymore? We can help you sort through the options.That year she starred in a Broadway revival of the musical “The Boy Friend,” but her life began spiraling out of control as a drug habit grew worse. She was arrested several times, and as a result she wasn’t being cast as readily as she had been, and her nightclub bookings dried up.She and Mr. Reynolds divorced in 1965, and in her 1985 autobiography, “Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside,” written with Bob Merrill, she wrote that Mr. Reynolds was abusive. In the memoir she confessed to myriad love affairs with name brand actors and others, and she acknowledged her drug abuse, including an addiction to heroin. A second marriage, to Robert Bergmann (sometimes spelled Bergman) in 1970, lasted less than a year, though he figured importantly later in her life. She leaves no immediate survivors.Mr. Barrett said he met Ms. Carne when she returned to England after the 1978 automobile accident, settling in Pitsford, near Northampton. He was a hairdresser and she came in to have her hair cut, he said. Ms. Carne was popular with her neighbors and performed occasionally in cabaret and dinner theater, he said, but she was frail and remained so. “She was a bit of a recluse toward the end,” Mr. Barrett said.The accident came about after she began spending time again with her former husband Mr. Bergmann. He was behind the wheel when their car went off the road in Bucks County, Pa., and she broke her neck.“I lost sight of myself in the last few years,” she told People magazine during her recuperation. “My whole life has been extremes. It took me near death to see the light at the end of the tunnel.”She added: “I guess this is the ultimate sock-it-to-me.”Advertisement",50409005,846,299890,1632,159,8592,"1"
1904,Woman stabs boyfriend for not liking Instagram selfie fast enough,"Newsworthy NewsDAVE WEASELCANTON, OH – A 22 year old woman was arrested after stabbing her boyfriend in the face with a sharpened selfie-stick because he did not like her post on Instagram within the allotted 10 minute timeframe.“This is atrocious, I can’t believe I am being charged for exercising what should be a constitutional right,” says the suspect. “This is 2015. When are the fat cats in Washington going to wake up and realize that when you are in a relationship, you must like your partner’s picture as soon as they post it. If anyone is the victim here, it is me.”Her lawyer also made a statement. “This young woman acted in self defence, he assaulted her feelings. She spent over 3 hours picking and adjusting the perfect filter for her selfie. She even logged into Facebook Messenger and saw he was ‘online now’ and had yet to acknowledge and validate her appearance, as though he thinks she is ugly. For the man to wait an entire 11 minutes is a senseless, barbaric act of violence towards her self-esteem.”“This woman is a political prisoner, persecuted because of her race” adds the DA, who plans to drop all charges.  “I too suffer from WGP [white girl problems] and am sick of people trying to hold me accountable for my unreasonable, borderline psychotic reactions to tedious things.

1907,'Great Pacific Garbage Patch' researchers devastated by sight,"Far away from California's coast, where the Pacific Ocean currents swirl, the blue of the sea was replaced by fishing nets, buckets, buoys, laundry baskets and unidentifiable pieces of plastic that floated past the Ocean Star, a ship carrying a team of scientists and volunteers gathering data on plastic garbage.""We were surrounded by an endless layer of garbage,"" sad Serena Cunsolo, an Italian marine biologist who works for The Ocean Cleanup. ""It was devastating to see.""Cunsolo, 28, was one of a team of 15 researchers and volunteers aboard the Ocean Starr who a month ago set out from San Francisco to study the plastic waste as part of the ""Mega Expedition,"" a major step in the organization's effort to eventually clean up what's known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.The 171-foot mother ship returned on Sunday to San Francisco, carrying massive white bags filled with plastic garbage along with two sailing boats with volunteers who helped collect the garbage samples.""It was a good illustration of why it is such an urgent thing to clean up because if we don't clean it up soon then we'll give the big plastic time to break into smaller and smaller pieces,"" Slat said. The minuscule particles can easily enter the food chain after being eaten by small fish and birds and are extremely difficult to clean up, he said.Volunteer crews on 30 boats have been measuring the size and mapping the location of tonnes of plastic waste floating between the West Coast and Hawaii that according to some estimates covers an area twice the size of Texas.Slat said the group will publish a report of its findings by mid-2016 and after that they hope to test out a 1.6-kilometre barrier to collect garbage near Japan. The ultimate goal is construction of a 100-kilometre  barrier in the middle of the Pacific.The expedition was sponsored by The Ocean Cleanup, an organization founded by Slat, a 21-year-old innovator from the Netherlands who has envisioned using long-distance floating barriers that will attach to the seabed and target swirling ocean currents full of waste and skim garbage from the surface while aquatic life and the currents themselves pass underneath.He became passionate about cleaning the oceans of plastic while diving in the Mediterranean Sea five years ago. ""I was diving in Greece and realized that there were more plastic bags than fish, and I wondered why can't we clean this up,"" Slat said.After dropping out of university after his first six months, Slat dedicated his life to developing the technology the group will start testing next year.After a 2012 Ted Talk about his idea was viewed more than two million times, Slat decided to launch a kick-starter campaign and raised two million euros (about $2.27 million US) that helped to launch his organization. Soon, his innovative solution got the attention of major philanthropists in Europe and Silicon Valley, including Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, who are helping pay for the data-gathering efforts and the technology's development.The Pacific expedition, which will end in mid-September, will gather data that will be more extensive than what has been collected in the past 40 years. It also will give a better estimate of how much plastic waste is in the Pacific Ocean, Slat said.The boaters are using GPS and a smartphone app to search for and record the plastic. They take samples and ship them to the Netherlands, where the plastics are counted and recorded.The Great Pacific Garbage Patch was discovered by Charles J. Moore in 1997 as he returned home from the Transpacific Yacht Race, which starts in Los Angeles and ends in Honolulu.To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

1919,"Steve Jobs' biological father was Syrian migrant, some note","NEW YORK—Steve Jobs biological father was from Syria, a fact that has not been lost on the Twittersphere, especially in the wake of the Syrian refugee crisis, and now the horrific massacre in Paris.Even before the latest violence, Syrian migration has been a hotbed issue throughout Europe and in the U.S.And some people couldn’t help but turn to Twitter, wondering if there would ever be a Steve Jobs or Apple if the most restrictive ""keep-them-out"" policies were in place.“Those who propose sweeping bans on refugees might want to consider this: Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian migrant,” tweeted The Nation writer John Nichols @NicholsUprising.""Worthy reminder: Steve Jobs biological father was also a #SyrianRefugee,"" tweeted Hanna Norberg, a Swedish trade economist.Steve Jobs’ biological father, Abdulfattah “John” Jandali, was born in 1931 to a prominent Syrian family, the youngest of nine children. He grew up in Homs, Syria, a city since ravaged by the nation’s civil war.After attacks in Paris, governors refuse to accept Syrian refugeesAccording to the authorized Steve Jobs biography written by Walter Isaacson, in the early 1950s, Jandali went to study at the American University in Beirut, and eventually on to the University of Wisconsin.While serving in Wisconsin as a teaching assistant, he met the woman who would become Steve Jobs’ biological mother, Joanne Schieble.Jandali and Schieble would eventually marry, but not until they put the future co-founder of Apple up for adoption, the year he was born, in 1955. The couple later had a daughter as well, the writer Mona Simpson.In the Jobs biography, Isaacson writes that they initially decided not to get married because Schieble’s father, who was dying at the time, “threatened to disown her if she wed Abdulfattah.”Years later, Jobs would “bristle whenever anyone referred to Paul and Clara Jobs as his `adoptive’ parents or implied that they were not his `real’ parents,” Isaacson wrote. Jobs, who died in 2011, instead referred to his biological parents as “my sperm and egg bank.”Jandali ended up in Nevada, working in the restaurant business. That's where he apparently met his son by happenstance, though he didn't know it at the time.Jobs told Issacson that he didn’t have any interest in meeting his biological father, though Simpson eventually tracked him down. And one of the most fascinating reveals in the Isaacson book comes in an episode in where Jandali tells Simpson that “he wished she could have seen him when he was managing a Mediterranean restaurant north of San Jose. `That was a wonderful place,’ he said. “All of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs.’ “Isaacson writes that Steve Jobs did maintain a friendly relationship with his biological mother, who after divorcing Jandali remarried for a short time to ice skating instructor George Simpson.And Jandali, who is still living, has been married four times.In a 2011 interview published by the Lebanese site, Ya Libnan, Jandali talked about his kids. “Steve is my biological son, but I didn’t bring him up, and he has a family that adopted him. So if it’s said that I’m the ‘father of invention’, then that’s because my biological son is a genius and my daughter a brilliant writer. I thank God for my success in life, but I’m no inventor….I’m proud of my son and his accomplishments, and of my work. Of course I made mistakes, and if I could go back in time I would have put some things right. I would have been closer to my son, but all’s well that ends well. Steve Jobs is one of the most successful people in America, and Mona is a successful academic and novelist.”Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter",4423424,886,19882,1899,341,23557,"0"

        Earlier this month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Q&A that the social network was getting ready to roll out a new button to let people express, in a single click, some sentiment other than ""like."" Though he made it clear that the new, more empathetic button would not say ""dislike,"" people are calling it exactly that -- and they can't wait to get it. Enter the scammers. Picking up on people's anticipation for a ""dislike"" button, a new scam circulating on Facebook prompts users to click to ""get newly introduced facebook dislike button on your profile.""Showing up in people's newsfeeds, the post claims the dislike button is an invite-only feature. It brings users to a page designed to look like it is branded by Facebook and instructs them to share the page, then send it to five groups to activate the button, according to hackread.com.Sophos security researchers writing on Naked Security said that clicking on the links brought them to two different scam sites, ""neither of which had anything to do with Facebook, or a Dislike button, and both of which wanted us to sign up by giving away personal information.""This is classic scam stuff. Facebook wouldn't make you jump through hoops to activate a new feature. Attackers and phishers often use the colors and logos of companies to make their fake sites look legitimate. Their links may lure users into sharing personal information or unwittingly downloading malware onto their machines. By requiring that people share the page, the attackers are effectively getting them to do their bidding, spreading the ill intentioned or malicious links to their network of friends.These all constitute major red flags.And crucially: There is no ""dislike"" button. It's not a thing, and it's not going to be, so don't fall for it.Zuckerberg made it clear that the company is eschewing the word ""dislike"" in its quest to make a button that lets people show empathy in circumstances when ""like"" just isn't appropriate, such when a friend posts bad news. ""Not every moment is a good moment,"" he said, adding that creating an appropriate option for a pushbutton response is ""surprisingly complicated.""Facebook said it could start testing the new button soon, and eventually roll it out to users more widely.

1933,Dylann Roof given free Burger King meal after Charleston church shooting,"By David Mccormack and Mia De Graaf For Dailymail.com   Published:  22:23 EDT, 22 June 2015   |  Updated:  15:50 EDT, 23 June 2015    339View  commentsThe police chief who arrested Dylann Roof has revealed that officers treated the 21-year-old accused of massacring nine innocent people in a Charleston church to a free meal from Burger King not long after arresting him.According to Shelby Police Chief Jeff Ledford, Roof complained of being hungry after he was arrested on Thursday and so officers bought him an undeserved burger and fries.Just sixteen hours earlier Roof had ruthlessly opened fire with a handgun at a prayer group in Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, because he wanted 'to kill black people'. Scroll down for video The police chief who arrested Dylann Roof has revealed that cops treated the 21-year-old accused of massacring nine people in a Charleston church to a free meal from Burger KingRoof was captured while on the run in Shelby, North Carolina, after authorities pulled over a Hyundai sedan which he had used to escape the scene of his killing spree. The FBI quickly stepped in and handled Roof's questioning after his swift arrest, but prior to that, during transport, his handling by the Shelby police 'He was very quiet, very calm. He didn't talk,' Ledford told the Charlotte Observer. 'He sat down here very quietly. He was not problematic.'Roof, a high school dropout who grew up around suburban Columbia, was charged on Friday with nine counts of murder and a weapons possession charge. Authorities found a .45-caliber handgun in his car.Shelby police stopped off at a branch of Burger King to pick up some food for murderer Dylann Roof after he complained that he was hungry (stock photo)Police lead suspected shooter Dylann Roof into the courthouse in Shelby, North Carolina, on ThursdayCiting anonymous sources, the Washington Post said Roof showed no remorse and expressed racist views even as he confessed to the crimes.The judge who arraigned Roof sparked outrage when he referred to the 21-year-old's family as 'victims' and urged the community to 'rally round them'.Charleston County Magistrate James Gosnell Jr told the court: 'We have victims - nine of them. But we also have victims on the other side. There are victims on this young man's side of the family.'The bizarre statement prompted outcry from the victims' families in the public gallery, and a torrent of complaints branding him 'insensitive' and 'racist'.And it has since emerged Gosnell was reprimanded in 2003 for using the n-word in court, when he told a black defendant: 'There are four kinds of people in this world - black people, white people, red necks, and n******.'Outrage: Judge James Gosnell Jr sparked outrage on Friday when he said Dylann Roof's relatives are 'victims'Nonetheless Gosnell was appointed to handle the Charleston shooting case on Friday and opened proceedings with his appeal to support Roof's family.'Nobody would have ever thrown them into the whirlwind of events that they are being thrown into,' he said.'We must find it in our heart at some point in time not only to help those that are victims but to also help his family as well.' He then charged Roof, whose grandfather C Joseph Roof is a prominent lawyer in North Carolina, with nine counts of murder. It came 12 years after he was hauled before the Supreme Court for using the n-word in a bond reduction hearing, and two days later unlawfully ordered the release of a fellow judge caught drunk driving, the Daily Beast reports.For both, he was merely reprimanded and has remained Chief Magistrate ever since.Notes from Gosnell's disciplinary hearing describe his defense of the n-word statement on November 6, 2003.'[Gosnell] represents he knew the defendant, the defendant's father, and the defendant's grandfather,' the court notes state, according to the Daily Beast.'[Gosnell] represents that when the defendant, an African-American, appeared in court for the bond hearing, [Gosnell] recalled a statement made to him by a veteran African American sheriff's deputy.'At the same hearing, the Supreme Court heard he went to great lengths to release a fellow judge from the county jail hours after he had been pulled over for driving under the influence with an open container on November 8, 2003.Joseph S Mendelsohn had called another judge in a desperate bid to get him out before he had to spend a night in the cells of Charleston County Detention Center.Gosnell, pictured charging Dylann Roof, was also reprimanded for sneaking a fellow judge out of jailWhen that judge refused, he called Gosnell.Gosnell, the court records reveal, told the on-duty officer to bring Mendelsohn straight to the bond court for a hearing. The officer refused as it was out of working hours and violated protocol.Gosnell then said he would come to the detention center himself to conduct a hearing. The officer said he would have to assemble staff to do so - and if he did they would be obliged to conduct hearings for every detainee.Deciding against that option, Gosnell traveled to the detention center alone.'[Gosnell] met the arresting officer and Judge Mendelsohn at the detention center,' the Supreme Court record says.'At some point, [Gosnell] took possession of the ticket, placed a 'bond hearing' stamp on the back, and entered the amount of $1,002.00. 'When detention center officials expressed concerns over Judge Mendelsohn's release, [Gosnell] remarked 'this didn't happen until 8:00 a.m.,' or words of similar import and effect.' Emotional: Relatives of the nine slain churchgoers made their way into the Charleston court on FridayThe families were left distraught when Gosnell told them the Roof family is as victimized as their dead relativesThe record adds: 'Gosnell] acknowledges it was his intention to facilitate Judge Mendelsohn's release without waiting for the morning bond hearing and to make it appear that Judge Mendelsohn's bond was set at 8:00 a.m. in accordance with Mount Pleasant's bond procedure.'After reviewing the evidence, the Supreme Court ruled 'a public reprimand' would be appropriate.  More than a decade later, Gosnell remained Chief Magistrate and was appointed to oversee the Charleston shooting case - an attack of national significance with terrorist and racist overtones.Reacting to Gosnell's statement on Friday, Twitter users erupted in rage at his 'insensitive' and even 'racist' approach to the case.Mia Farrow, the actress, tweeted: 'Judge James Gosnell of #Charleston is obviously part of the problem. Jesus Christ!!!!'A user called MiMi wrote: 'Judge Gosnell DONE lost his mind. Right now, who gives a damn! His family bought the murder weapon! #DylannRoof'And one named Elizabeth said: 'Watching Judge James Gosnell lecture the families of victims in court re: sympathy for Roof family made me sick. Racism not thinly veiled.'REVEREND CLEMENTA PINCKNEYClementa Pinckney, 41Clementa Pinckney, 41, was the beloved pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the country's oldest black churches, and had been a state legislator for 19 years. He has been remembered as a 'giant' and a 'legend' by his peers. Just one year after graduating from Allen University in 1995, Pinckney became, at 23, the youngest African-American elected to the South Carolina Legislature. In 2000, he was elected to the state Senate.He earned a master's degree in public administration from the University of South Carolina in 1999 and studied at the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary.A native of Beaufort, Pinckney began preaching at age 13 and was first appointed pastor at 18. He was named pastor of Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2010, according to the state Democratic Party.  'He had a core not many of us have,' said Sen. Vincent Sheheen, who sat beside him in Senate chambers. 'I think of the irony that the most gentle of the 46 of us — the best of the 46 of us in this chamber — is the one who lost his life.'He is survived by his wife and two children.REVEREND SHARONDA COLEMAN-SINGLETONSharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45Reverend Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, was a part-time minister at Emanuel AME Church and worked as a speech pathologist at Goose Creek High School, where she was also the girls track coach.Principal Jimmy Huskey said she was so dedicated she was at work before 8am and typically didn't leave until 8pm.'She had a big smile,' Huskey said. 'Her No 1 concern was always the students. She made a difference in the lives of children. She cannot be replaced here at this school.'The mother of three had run track herself as a student at South Carolina State University, helping lead her team to a conference championship.Also a speech therapist and ministerial staff member at the church, she was hailed as an 'excellent role model'.'We love you, Coach Singleton,' the team wrote on its Facebook page. 'Gator Nation is where it is today because of your leadership. You have our thoughts and prayers.'Her son, Chris Singleton, who is at college, wrote on his Twitter page after the shooting: 'Something extremely terrible has happened to my mom tonight, please pray for her and my family. Pray asap.'On Instagram, he shared an image of his mother beside the Reverend Pinckney, and wrote: 'In this pictured are two new Angels in the sky. One of them happens to be my mommmy.Ethel Lance, 70'It's funny how I always told you that you went to church too much. You would laugh it off and say, 'Boy you can never have too much of the Lord.'' ETHEL LANCEEthel Lance, 70, was a Charleston native who had been a member of the church for most of her life. She retired after working for more than 30 years on the housekeeping staff at the city's Gaillard Auditorium.She had served as a sexton at the church for the last five years, helping to keep the historic building clean. She was also a lover of gospel music.'She was a God-fearing woman,' said granddaughter Najee Washington, 23, who lived with Lance. 'She was the heart of the family, and she still is. She is a very caring, giving and loving woman. She was beautiful inside and out.''Granny was the heart of the family,' her grandson Jon Quil Lance told The Post and Courier. 'She's a Christian, hardworking; I could call my granny for anything. I don't have anyone else like that'.   Susie Jackson, 87Lance had five children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.SUSIE JACKSONSusie Jackson, 87, was a longtime church member and sang in the choir. She and Ethel Lance were cousins. Jackson had recently visited her son and grandchildren in Cleveland, Ohio.Tim Jackson told Cleveland television station WEWS that his grandmother was a loving, giving woman with a great smile.'It's just hard to process that my grandmother had to leave Earth this way,' he said. 'It's real, real hard. It's challenging because I don't believe she deserved to go this way.'Susie Jackson, who was fond of playing slot machines, was scheduled to go on a church-sponsored bus trip to Chicago on Sunday and was looking forward to going to the top of the Willis Tower, said Jean Jackson, an associate member of the church. Tywanza Sanders, 26TYWANZA SANDERSThe youngest person killed in the attack was Tywanza Sanders, who graduated from Allen University's division of business administration in Columbia last year.'He was a quiet, well-known student who was committed to his education,' according to a statement from Allen University. 'He presented a warm and helpful spirit as he interacted with his colleagues. 'Mr. Sanders was participating in the Bible Study session at Mother Emanuel church at the time of the shooting.' His social media pages also indicate he worked at a barber shop.Sanders posted his last Instagram picture before the meeting last night.'A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives,' it read, quoting Jackie Robinson.DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49DEPAYNE MIDDLETON-DOCTORWhether she was working with college students or Charleston's poorest residents, DePayne Middleton-Doctor wanted to be in a position to help people.So co-workers weren't surprised when she decided to become a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.'She was a woman of God,' said Joel Crawford, who worked with Middleton-Doctor at Southern Wesleyan University's campus in Charleston. 'She was strong in her faith.'Middleton-Doctor, a 49-year-old mother of four daughters, just started her job as an enrollment counselor at the university in December, said Crawford, who worked with her as a student services coordinator.Before that, Middleton-Doctor had been employed for several years by Charleston County, where she helped administer grants aimed at helping the county's poorest residents with problems they couldn't otherwise afford to fix such as repairing roofs or septic tanks, said J. Elliott Summey, chairman of the Charleston County Council. He said she left her county job in 2005.Crawford said Middleton-Doctor often went to midweek prayer meetings at Emanuel AME Church as she worked toward becoming a minister. Cynthia Hurd, 54On Facebook, her sister paid tribute to her 'beautiful Songbird'.'I will truly miss you my love,' she wrote. 'Your beautiful personality, your laughter, your smile, and your love for everyone.' CYNTHIA HURDCynthia Hurd's brother took some comfort in knowing that his sister died in the church she grew up in and loved.Hurd, 54, was the manager of one of the busiest branches of the Charleston County library system. In her honor, the system closed all 16 of its branches Thursday, the day after her death.She grew up in Charleston, and her mother made sure they went Emanuel AME Church on Sundays, Wednesdays and any other time it was open, said her brother Malcom Graham, a former state senator from North Carolina.'I wasn't surprised on a Wednesday night she was there,' Graham said Thursday.Myra Thompson, 59Hurd's husband is a merchant sailor currently at sea near Saudi Arabia. Graham was trying to help him get home.When Graham spoke to his sister last weekend, she said she couldn't wait for her 55th birthday on Sunday, he said.She was also looking toward retirement after 31 years of library work. 'Cynthia was a tireless servant of the community who spent her life helping residents, making sure they had every opportunity for an education and personal growth,' the library said in a statement.'Her loss is incomprehensible, and we ask for prayers for her family, her co-workers, her church and this entire community as we come together to face this tragic loss.'MYRA THOMPSONMyra Thompson, 59, was also killed at the church, her daughter confirmed but would not comment further.Daniel Simmons, 45Thompson was the wife of Rev Anthony Thompson, Vicar of Holy Trinity REC (ACNA) Church in Charleston. Archbishop Foley Beach wrote on Facebook: 'Please join me in praying for the Rev. Anthony Thompson, Vicar of Holy Trinity REC (ACNA Church in Charleston, his family, and their congregation, with the killing of his wife, Myra, in the Charleston shootings last night.' Thompson's daughter is reportedly a prominent figure in Atlanta's Big Bethel AME Church.DANIEL L SIMMONSDaniel L Simmons, 45, a retired pastor from another church in Charleston, also died. He attended the church every Sunday for services and Wednesdays for bible study, his daughter-in-law said.Unlike the other victims, he was rushed to hospital but he passed away on the operating table, the coroner said.     Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group",356494,1821,12950,1133,733,24599,"0"

1946,White Supremacist Who Influenced Charleston Suspect Donated to 2016 G.O.P. Campaigns,"AdvertisementSupported byBy Eric LichtblauThe leader of a white supremacist group that apparently influenced Dylann Roof, the suspect in the killing of nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church last week, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republican campaigns, including those of 2016 presidential contenders such as Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Rand Paul, records show.Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, said Sunday night that he would be returning about $8,500 in donations that he had received from the Texas donor, Earl Holt III, who lists himself as president of the Council of Conservative Citizens.“We just learned this evening that Mr. Holt had contributed to the campaign,” a spokesman for the Cruz campaign said in an email to The New York Times. “We will be immediately refunding all those donations.”Mr. Paul’s campaign said Monday that it planned to send $2,250 received from Mr. Holt to a victims’ fund set up in the wake of the shooting.“RandPAC is donating the funds to the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund to assist the victims families,” said Sergio Gor, a spokesman for the campaign. Mr. Holt made four separate donations to the Paul campaign last year, records show. The campaign could not confirm the total received but said that all the money it identified from the white supremacist leader would be donated to the fund.The Guardian first reported on Mr. Holt’s donations to the Republican contenders.A manifesto that appeared on a website registered to Mr. Roof said that the manifesto’s author had first learned of “brutal black-on-white murders” from the Council of Conservative Citizens’ website.Mr. Holt, in a statement posted online in his name, said he was not surprised to learn that Mr. Roof had found out about “black-on-white violent crime” from his group because, he said, it was one of the few that had the courage to disclose “the seemingly endless incidents involving black-on-white murder.” But he said his group does not advocate violence and should not be held responsible for the shootings.The group is regarded by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a leading authority on hate crimes, as a white supremacist extremist organization that opposes “race mixing” as a religious affront and that vilifies blacks as an inferior race.Spokesmen for Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, and Mr. Paul, a senator from Kentucky, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the donations.Mr. Holt, who identified himself in some donation records as a Texas “slumlord,” has also given money to a number of other current and former Republican members of Congress, including Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, former Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Representative Steve King of Iowa, and former Representative Todd Akin of Missouri.Advertisement",141691,59852,3584,3124,526,5515,"0"

	James Earl Jones  Dead?","FACT CHECK:    Has actor James Earl Jones passed away?Claim:   Actor James Earl Jones passed away in August 2015.    FALSEExample:     [Collected via Twitter, August 2015]Origins:    On 26 August 2015, a news-like link reporting that veteran actor James Earl Jones (famously known, among many other prominent roles, as the voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars series of films) had passed away in Arkabutla, Mississippi, at the age of 84 began circulating via social media. Although the link appeared to point to a real news story, it actually directed users to the prank web site Feednewz.com where they were greeted by a “You Got Owned” meme:Anyone can create a “prank” headline on FeedNewz.com, a site that fosters users’ spreading false but sensational claims across the Internet and then encourages those who have already been fooled to continue sharing the joke.The web site has also been responsible for promulgating false rumors about Taco Bell‘s closing, Mountain Dew‘s being discontinued, and MMA champion Ronda Rousey‘s failing a drug test.Last updated:      26 August 2015Originally published:    26 August 2015CompanyNavigateSectionsAccount© 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc.This material may not be reproduced without permission.Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com",298651,87,6857,2583,873,3868,"0"

Our editorial content is not influenced by any commissions we receive.© Complex Media, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Complex.com is a part ofTrace William Cowen is a writer who also tweets with dramatic irregularity here.Share This StoryAccording to Salon, domestic terrorist Dylann Storm Roof was ""hungry"" when police officers found and arrested him in Shelby, North Carolina. Roof had reportedly purchased Doritos and a beverage from a nearby gas station, but wasn't quite full — so cops covered the Burger King tab shortly after the arrest. Roof, of course, was wanted following his brutal act of domestic terrorism at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Charleston, South Carolina.Lest you forget, Roof was a staunch white supremacist with a troubling pattern of violent language across various messageboards, including:""I chose Charleston because it is most [sic] historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites [sic] in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.""Roof's murder of 9 church attendees sparked two separate though chillingly intertwined debates surrounding the issues of gun control and the presence of the Confederate flag, respectively. According to reports on Monday, Senator Lindsey Graham is calling for the Confederate flag to be removed from state grounds — an admirable though embarrassingly overdue sentiment of rejecting the continued influence of the South's racist history by (hopefully) acknowledging it and moving forward. Related StoriesSTORY CONTINUES BELOWJoin the conversation on Complex today!Share This Story",409178,2229,17506,692,102,3111,"0"
1978,Whole Foods' $6 Asparagus Water Is Just Water With Three Stalks of Asparagus in It [Updated],"Filed under:Is Whole Foods trolling its own employees?If you buy something from an Eater link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics policy.Posted on Aug 3, 2015 at 8:03am PDT

Twitter user Layla Dhere (@dhere) expressed confusion in a recent tweet featuring the above image of a row of bottles of what is labeled ""Asparagus Water"" on a shelf. The bottles appear to be filled with water and three stalks of raw asparagus. They are priced at $5.99 each. Dhere is right to be perplexed.""The nutrients from the asparagus do transfer into the water.""The labels say ""Whole Foods,"" and the date on the bottles is current. A call to the supermarket (these particular bottles are from the Whole Foods in Brentwood, Calif. though in the New York City area grocery delivery service Instacart, which is a partner of Whole Foods, lists ""Asparagus Water"") at first produced some bewilderment. The operator denied the product existed. Eventually she transferred the call to a gentleman in the produce department who did not want to give his name. He explained that the product was new, ""We've had them on the shelf for the last few days."" When asked how the item is made, he said, ""It's water, and we sort of cut asparagus stalks down so they're shorter, and put them into the container."" When Eater asked what it was for, there was a long pause before he said, ""Well, it's... to drink."" He elaborated, ""The nutrients from the asparagus do transfer into the water.""As a point of comparison, Whole Foods has whole bundles of asparagus on sale for about $5.A search for ""Asparagus Water"" doesn't turn up any recipes or news articles; it's seemingly not a common item. And the Whole Foods employees Eater spoke with said it was not a product that had been requested by customers. Eater has reached out to Whole Foods' corporate office for comment. Perhaps Whole Foods' Asparagus Water will be sold for $3.99 at its new lower-priced 365 markets.But maybe the pricey grocer is ahead of the game and vegetable water is the new bone broth? Or, Whole Foods is trolling its own employees, and ripping off customers as usual.Update 8/3/15; 6:20 p.m. EST: Whole Foods' Senior Media Relations Specialist Liz Burkhart responded to Eater's request for comment by explaining that it was all a big misunderstanding:""We appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We looked into this right away and found that this item was being carried in just one of our stores in California. It was meant to be water with the essence of vegetables and/or mushrooms to be used as broth (similar to a bone broth), which are typically made over a long period of time soaking in water. The product was made incorrectly and has since been removed from the one store where it was carried. We read your story, and would love your help clarifying that this product isn't and never has been available for online ordering on Instacart and was only ever offered in one store.""Eater Video: A great way to incorporate vegetables into your dishesThe freshest news from the food world every dayCheck your inbox for a welcome email.From adult vitamins to CBD and THC versions, gummies have come a long way from the candy aisle.

1981,Pakistani security seeks to tamp down reporting on California shooter,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Mehreen Zahra-Malik4 Min ReadMULTAN, Pakistan, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Pakistani security forces appeared to be trying to dampen down reporting this weekend on the background of Tashfeen Malik, who mounted an attack alongside her husband that killed 14 people in California.Three professors at Malik’s university said they had been advised not to talk to the media, while men claiming to be from Pakistan’s security agencies told reporters to drop their investigations into her background on pain of arrest.An official at the interior ministry later said this was due to a “misunderstanding”.U.S. authorities are treating last Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino as an “act of terrorism”. Malik, 29, and husband Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, were killed two hours later in a shootout with police.The Iraq- and Syria-based Islamic State jihadist group has claimed the couple as its followers, although it has not said it was in contact with them or that it directed the attack.Malik was born in Pakistan but spent most of her life in Saudi Arabia before she came to the United States to marry her husband, a U.S. citizen. She had a degree in pharmacy from a university in Pakistan’s central city of Multan.On Sunday, three professors at Bahauddin Zakariya University, which Malik attended, said they had been instructed by security agencies not to speak to reporters.One, who asked not to be named, said security officials visited the university on Saturday and removed records and pictures of Tashfeen.“She was a very reserved person, a very quiet girl, she kept to herself,” the professor said. “I could have never imagined she was capable of something like this. And there was nothing on the surface to suggest she had such extremist tendencies.”“I think this change in her mind, whenever it happened, must be very recent. The girl I remember ... she could not have the guts to do this.”Another former professor said he did not remember her at all. “She was probably not someone who stood out, academically or otherwise,” he said.Men claiming to be from security agencies, but who refused to provide identification, also sought to discourage Reuters from further reporting on Malik’s background, threatening journalists with arrest for unspecified offences.“Whether you consider this a request or a dictation (order), I would advise you not to pursue this story,” one said.Tim Craig, a reporter from the Washington Post, tweeted that police had prevented him from leaving his hotel in Multan.“I’ve lost track of how many different security/intel officials I’ve had to talk to, copy my passport, etc in past 17 hours - think 12 to 16,” he tweeted.Reuters was eventually allowed to continue reporting with a police escort provided for security reasons.An interior ministry official later told Reuters the situation had been the result of a misunderstanding by over-enthusiastic local police.“This is not our policy. We have nothing to hide, and we want to facilitate journalists,” the official, who did not wish to be named, said.Several security officials said the restrictions on the press were partly due to Pakistani fears that the country would be blamed for Malik’s actions.“Pakistan has nothing to do with this but it will be used to malign Pakistan. So of course we have to care about how this is being seen and reported,” one official said.On Sunday, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar said Pakistan was willing to give any assistance that the United States required to investigate Malik, and highlighted that she spent most of her life in Saudi Arabia.“Such acts of terrorism which take place across the world bring a bad name to Islam,” he said. “You cannot blame the religion and the nation due to the personal actions of one person.” (Additional reporting by Syed Raza Hassan in KARACHI; Writing by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Douglas Busvine and Richard Balmforth)Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

	Farting Burns 67 Calories?","In mid-November 2015, many Internet users became aware that Google returned an interesting search result to those who asked the search engine if farting burned calories:Although Google may return the results shown above to such a query, the source the search engine cited for this information, a Facebook page called “F A C T,” does not offer any evidence proving this claim. In fact, the only source provided by “F A C T” was Google itself: “Google is your friend if you think these facts are false.”The Facebook page “F A C T,” however, didn’t pull this number out of thin air. The claim that a single fart burns approximately 67 calories has been floating around the internet since at least 2009, when an Internet troll responded to a question on ChaCha thusly: How many calories does farting burn?The amount of calories burned by farting would depend on how long the fart lasts and how much energy you use to do it. Some people believe you can burn up to 67 calories by releasing gas.It should be noted that similar inquiries posed via ChaCha also prompted answers of less than one calorie, not very many calories, and no calories.So how many calories do you burn during a single fart? Unsurprisingly, we weren’t able to uncover much scientific research on the subject. But according to a post on the web site Fat Loss School, the number is much lower than 67:Some people get a bit desperate when it comes to weight loss. They start wondering which of their daily activities burns enough calories to warrant increasing the frequency. We get questions about calorie consumption in a host of different scenarios. But perhaps the strangest question posed to date is: how many calories do you burn by farting?If you take a moment to think about this, the answer is rather obvious: none! When you fart, your muscles relax and the gas pressure in your bowels do all the work in expelling the gas. The only way you would achieve a measureable figure in the calories burned farting is if you really strained yourself to the limit.CompanyNavigateSectionsAccount© 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc.This material may not be reproduced without permission.Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com",298651,87,6906,1023,1291,143827,"0"

When not working, she enjoys pretending she knows what she's doing in the kitchen.Share This StoryUPDATED, 2:06 p.m. ETTexas plumber Mark Oberholtzer is suing the Houston car dealership that sold his pickup truck without first removing his business's decal for over $1 million—because the truck ended up in the hands of the Islamic State (ISIS). After trading in his 2005 Ford F-250 truck to Charlie Thomas Ford in 2013, Oberholtzer had no idea it would wind up associated with the extremist organization. The vehicle's CARFAX history report shows the truck sold at a Texas auction on Nov. 11, 2013; then nearly one month later, it arrived in Mersin, Turkey, according to Oberholtzer​'s lawsuit. From there, things only get more bizarre. On Dec. 15, 2014, Caleb Weiss, a contributor at the Long War Journal researching jihadist groups, tweeted a photo that clearly showed Oberholtzer's truck being used as an anti-aircraft vehicle in Syria. (The suit claims Weiss is a ""member of Ansar al-Deen, a jihadist group operating near Aleppo in Syria."")The truck prominently displays 'Mark-1 Plumbing' on its side, as well as Oberholtzer's business phone number. Chechen Jaish al Muhajireen wal Ansar using plumbing truck against regime in #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/QQwJuIfV7FTwo days after the tweet, when the media got wind of the story, Oberholtzer claimed in his suit that he received more than 1,000 threatening phone calls from people who believed he was aiding and abetting terrorists. It didn't help that Stephen Colbert picked up on the story for the last episode of The Colbert Report, which was viewed by nearly 2.5 million people. The threats and publicity forced Oberholtzer to shut down his business for seven days, and consult with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the FBI about his personal safety, according to the suit. He claime that he has since started carrying a handgun for protection.When Oberholtzer traded in his vehicle, he attempted to remove the decal, the lawsuit said; however, a salesman informed him that the dealership had a stronger solution that would prevent paint damage, and the staff would take care of it. Oberholtzer had no idea the truck ""would be transferred in some fashion to international jihadists conducting warfare upon innocents in Syria,"" according to the suit. Mark-1 Plumbing, Inc. v. Charlie Thomas Ford, Ltd. by Robert WilonskyOberholtzer​ did not immediately respond to NTRSCTN's request for comment.Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Caleb Weiss as associated with Ansar Al-Deen.

2006,New SeaWorld Show Just Elephant Drowning In Large Tank Of Water With No Explanation,"ORLANDO, FL—Noting that the show had simply appeared on the park’s schedule last week without an announcement or fanfare of any kind, visitors to SeaWorld told reporters Thursday that the theme park’s latest attraction consists solely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water with no explanation.The most recent addition to the amusement park’s slate of entertainment—listed on brochures and signs simply as “Elephant Drowning”—reportedly features an adult African elephant that is led out by trainers into the main amphitheater, where it is immediately shoved into a 36-foot-deep aquarium and left to slowly die, all without the music, lighting cues, or narration that typically accompany other SeaWorld shows.“After they pushed it into the pool, it swam around for a little while, which was cool because I didn’t even know elephants could swim, but then it started really struggling to keep its head above water,” said visitor Katie Hayes, 32, who attended the 1 p.m. Elephant Drowning performance with her family after seeing a sign advertising the show simply as “SeaWorld’s Newest Experience.” “My kids were cheering for it at first, and we all thought it might do some tricks or something. But it just sort of thrashed around the whole time, trying to get out of there.”“And then it drowned,” Hayes added.“Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you’ve come to expect from SeaWorld, and it’s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages.”Other guests who attended the same performance reported that they were left confused when the handlers appeared unannounced, silently forced the full-grown elephant into the tank, and then walked out through the backstage door, all without saying a word or acknowledging the audience in any way. Additionally, many said they were expecting someone to come on over the loudspeaker and tell them what was occurring, or at least mention the elephant’s name, but noted that no one ever did.Over the course of the half-hour show, the 12,000-pound animal reportedly grew increasingly panicked, making numerous futile attempts to scramble up and over the vertical sides of the enclosure. Sources said the clapping and whistling from the audience slowly tapered off as the exhausted elephant made gradually slower circuits of the tank’s perimeter in a desperate search of any possible exit point it could use to save itself.“It tried to smash through the side of the tank with its tusks at one point, which is when I thought some dolphins or an orca might come swimming out of the gate and help push the elephant to safety, which would have been incredible—but nope,” said SeaWorld guest Erika Morganstern, 22, who suspected that the tank walls had been heavily reinforced, given the animal’s continuous, ultimately ineffectual efforts to throw its enormous bulk against the glass. “Eventually, the elephant started making these crazy sorts of gurgling, trumpeting noises that got quieter and quieter before they stopped completely.”“I really wasn’t sure what to expect when I saw this show on the schedule,” she added. “But, yeah, it was pretty much just an elephant drowning.”Visitors said that following some violent, last-ditch floundering, the huge mammal at last became too worn out to continue treading water and succumbed. Guests watching the show from the underwater viewing area confirmed seeing the elephant drift slowly to the bottom of the tank, where it came to rest in a heap, its body reportedly shifting back and forth slightly due to the turbulence created by its prior struggling.“No one really told us when the show was over,” said season-pass holder Mariam O’Neill, 57. “After the elephant didn’t move for a while, people got up and started leaving. A few people stuck around for the Clyde & Seamore’s Sea Lion High show, which was coming up next.”According to sources, the Elephant Drowning attraction has been well-attended since its introduction earlier this month, with the Saturday afternoon show in particular, which reportedly features both a mother elephant and her calf, regularly filling to capacity.When reached for comment, SeaWorld representatives confirmed to reporters that their newest aquatic presentation consists entirely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water and that it takes place in Shamu Stadium at the times listed on the park’s website.“SeaWorld is proud to bring a brand-new attraction to its visitors,” company representative Nancy Klemmer said. “Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you’ve come to expect from SeaWorld, and it’s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages.”“Plus, the elephants absolutely love it,” Klemmer added.",11682377,7,12311,865,2393,493018,"0"

        Whole Foods selling a bottle of water with three stalks of raw asparagus inside and calling it ""Asparagus Water"" didn't seem real.But it wasn't a joke -- and neither was its $5.99 price tag.When shopper Marielle Wakim, an associate editor at Los Angeles magazine, spotted the water sitting on shelves in a California Whole Foods supermarket, she had to stop to do a double take.""Somewhere in L.A., Whole Foods executives are laughing at all of us,"" she wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of the so-called ""Asparagus Water"" product.More than 100 people liked the photo, which quickly spread online.As an L.A. resident, Wakim is used to health food trends like kale soft-serve or ""Swole Cakes,"" but this product struck her as ridiculous.""Tap water, after all, is free, and an entire bundle of asparagus from Whole Foods costs around $5,"" Wakim said. ""In fact, I was half-sure it was a joke.""Apparently, Twitter users did, too.""You could buy a knitting pattern for $6 that takes HOURS of labor to produce, or you could spend same $6 on a bottle of ASPARAGUS WATER,"" one user tweeted.""If any of you ever catch me buying a $6 bottle of ""asparagus water"" at Whole Foods - or anywhere - you are free to punch me on sight,"" another responded.After thousands of people took to the Internet to discuss ""Asparagus Water(gate),"" Whole Foods addressed the outlandish item.""We actually don't sell asparagus water in our stores,"" Whole Foods Market Senior Media Relations Specialist Liz Burkhart told CBS News. ""We looked into the item as soon as it was brought to our attention.""The water was ""carried briefly"" in just one store in Brentwood, California, but it has now been removed.""It was meant to be water with the essence of vegetables and/or mushrooms (similar to bone broth), which is typically made over a long period of time soaking in water,"" Burkhart explained. ""It was made incorrectly and has since been removed.""Whole Foods has been under scrutiny for over-pricing and mislabeling ever since New York City's consumer chief released details on an investigation in June that showed the chain's supermarkets have been routinely overcharging customers by overstating the weight of prepackaged meat, dairy and baked goods.Wakim was relieved to hear that ""Asparagus Water"" was just a ""snafu"" on the grocer's part.""I'm sure people who saw it experienced some sort of sticker shock ($6 for a bottle of water?!) combined with disbelief that such a thing would even exist,"" she said.Fortunately, for Wakim -- and other shoppers who got caught up in the great ""Asparagus Water"" debate -- it no longer does.I may be restless but at least I'm not buy-a-$6-bottle-of-whole-foods-asparagus-water restless.Whole Foods is selling bottles of water with asparagus stalks in it for $6. This is how Rome fell.I live among the people who would buy asparagus water at whole foods tbh.

December 2, 2015 The Times has concluded its live coverage of the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., which killed
                                                        14 people and wounded 21. Look back at how the events unfolded.President Obama was sitting down for an interview with CBS News shortly after being briefed about the shooting by his homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco. During the interview, Mr. Obama expressed
                                                        condolences for the victims and once again remarked that legislation could reduce the chances of such shootings recurring.

News Editor, Variety.comActress Judy Carne, best known for being the “Sock it to me!” girl on “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In” in the ’60s, died on Sept. 3, according to the Telegraph. She was 76.Carne rose to overnight fame with her appearances on “Laugh-In,” where the bouncy actress’ zany persona would be doused with water every time she uttered the phrase “Sock it to me,” accidentally or not. She acted on the sketch comedy show for two years, making the occasional appearance in the third season.Carne was also known for her tumultuous relationship with Burt Reynolds. She was the actor’s first wife, marrying him in 1963 before they divorced in 1965. She detailed their relationship, confessing to partaking in several affairs and struggling with drug addiction, in her 1985 autobiography “Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl.” 








She battled heavily with drug addiction after leaving “Laugh-In,” being charged with heroin possession and prescription forgery in the late ’70s. She was acquitted of the heroin charge.The actress was born near Northampton, Northamptonshire, England, and trained at the Bush Davies Theatrical School for Girls at East Grinstead as a child. Her first television appearance came in 1956, in “The First Day of Spring.”Carne went on to serve as a panelist on “Juke Box Jury” and also appeared on sitcom “The Rag Trade,” as well as the 1962 comedy film “A Pair of Briefs.”Her other TV credits include a regular role in sitcom “Fair Exchange,” “The Baileys of Balboa,” a starring role in sitcom “Love on a Rooftop” and appearances in “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”

In an interview with France Inter radio, the former Charlie Hebdo publisher Phillipe Val said: ‘I’ve lost all of my friends today.’In a moving tribute to his slain former colleagues, Val, who has also been director of France Inter, said:“They were so alive, they loved to make people happy, to make them laugh, to give them generous ideas. They were very good people. They were the best among us, as those who make us laugh, who are for liberty ... They were assassinated, it is an insufferable butchery.“We cannot let silence set in, we need help. We all need to band together against this horror. Terror must not prevent joy, must not prevent our ability to live, freedom, expression – I’m going to use stupid words – democracy, after all this is what is at stake. It is this kind of fraternity that allows us to live. We cannot allow this, this is an act of war. It might be good if tomorrow, all newspapers were called Charlie Hebdo. If we titled them all Charlie Hebdo. If all of France was Charlie Hebdo. It would show that we are not okay with this. That we will never let stop laughing. We will never let liberty be extinguished.”(translated from French by @rayajalabi)Read the full interview in French here.Updated

It was very quiet and respectful, with no trouble as far as I could see. I often go to demos there and as such am able to judge how many people are at them reasonably well. The square was full this evening and the adjacent roads were blocked too so I'd put the figure at between 10 and 10 thousand, that which the local press confirms as I've just read upon getting back home after leaving the demo as it began to disperse.My thoughts go to the victims and their families.Sent via Guardian Witness By fripouille  7 January 2015, 13:26 This is a store on rue Daguerre in south Paris.

The Guardian’s Ben Quinn (@benquinn75) has been speaking with French expatriates at the gathering at Trafalgar Square. “In one the largest vigils outside of France, around 2,000 French citizens and others gathered in Trafalgar Square, London – sometimes dubbed Frances’s “sixth largest city” on account of the number of expats living there,” Ben writes:In silence, they shed tears, joined in a chorus of the marsellaise and held previous covers of Charlie Hedbo. Some just held up pens and pencils, which were eventually left in the middle of the gathering, which had been quickly organised earlier in the day on Facebook without any apparent leadership.“We’re here because of freedom of the press and freedom of expression generally, but we’re also here because we’re sad,” said Arnaud Vervoitte, a Frenchman who has lived in the UK in the UK for 21 and works with a youth organiation in London.In common with others, he also cited fears of a right-led backlash in his homeland.“If the reports are accurate then I am scared that it is going to feed into more Far Right politics which have been a massive issue in France and we have already seen the Front National using the issue without evening knowing the details.”Another French expat, Marie Proffit, added: “We are shocked. We know that there should be a place for satirical press in Europe. “We’re also sure though that this was not about muslim people – it was about some really really extreme people.”“I am very worried about what might happen next – that the Front National will try to use this to their advantage. It doesn’t represent France at all.”Others in the crowd included Aykut Mercan, a Turkish London, who was holding a placard in Turkish saying: “Je Suis Charlie Hepimiz”. He said: “I’m here to support Freedom of Speech. What happened in Paris was shocking and hard to understand really. It wasn’t in my name.”

2146,Landmark: Supreme Court Rules Same-Sex Marriage Legal Nationwide,"SectionsTVFeaturedMore from NBC Follow NBC News The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday made marriage for same-sex couples legal nationwide, declaring that refusing to grant marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples violates the Constitution.The landmark ruling will produce the most significant change in laws governing matrimony since the court struck down state bans on inter-racial marriage almost 50 years ago.The majority opinion in the 5-4 decision was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy.""No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were,"" Kennedy wrote. ""As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death.""Related: Supreme Court Gay Marriage Ruling: The HighlightsKennedy went on to speak directly to the type of criticism that often comes from conservatives in pushing back against marriage equality.""It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves,"" Kennedy wrote. ""Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.""A total of 36 states now permit gay couples to get married, covering roughly 70 percent of the US population. Today's ruling means the bans must end in the other 14 states — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.President Barack Obama, speaking from the White House just after the ruling, called the decision a ""victory for America.""""When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free,"" the president said.After sundown on Friday, the White House celebrated the ruling by projecting rainbow-colored lights onto the house's exterior.https://www.instagram.com/p/4amdDFx98NObama's own views on the matter of same-sex marriage have evolved and he has pushed increasingly for issues of gay rights in his second term.From the White House Rose Garden, he said that social progress sometimes is slow, “and then there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.”Those at the heart of the case said they recognized the historical significance of the decision.“Today’s ruling affirms what millions of people across this country already know to be true in our hearts: Our love is equal” Jim Obergefell, the lead plantiff in the landmark case said outside of the Supreme Court after the ruling. “It is my hope that the term gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past. It will simply be marriage. And our nation will be better for it.”The president called Obergefell to congratulate him shortly after the decision was announced. Obergefell took the call while he was being interviewed live on CNN.“Your leadership on this changed the country,” Obama told him.#LoveWins. pic.twitter.com/s5aiwIsFz8The decision capped a remarkably quick turnaround in public and judicial acceptance of same-sex marriage. In the past 18 months, court rulings struck down marriage bans in rapid succession — nearly 60 separate decisions in more than half the states.Related: 'Historic Victory': Reactions to Supreme Court's Gay Marriage Ruling Pour InToday's ruling overturned a decision from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, which said states had legitimate reasons for maintaining the traditional definition of marriage. The appeals court also said it would be better ""to allow change through the customary political processes"" instead of the courts.Public opinion has shifted dramatically in recent years. The first Gallup poll on the subject showed only 27 percent approval for same-sex marriage in 1996. Gallup's most recent poll, taken last month, showed 60 percent approval.Writing for the dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts said that while he recognizes that many will applaud the decision, ""for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach is deeply disheartening.""""This universal definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman is no historical coincidence. Marriage did not come about as a result of a political movement, discovery, disease, war, religious doctrine, or any other moving force of world history — and certainly not as a result of a prehistoric decision to exclude gays and lesbians,"" Roberts wrote. ""It arose in the nature of things to meet a vital need: ensuring that children are conceived by a mother and father committed to raising them in the stable conditions of a lifelong relationship.""Outside of the court, people sang ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as the decision came out.People spilled into the street in front of the Supreme Court building and across the roadway. Initially, police asked people to move back onto the sidewalk, but eventually let them spill out into one lane in front of the court. Passing police cars honked as people cheered and waved little blue flags with yellow equal signs.Crystal Hardin of Arlington, Va. brought her three and five-year old kids.""I decided to come out because I've been a long time supporter of marriage equality and I brought the kids because I figured the decision would go this way and I wanted them to be here,"" Hardin said. ""I feel like in the future it will be important for them to know that they were here, we were supporting it, and you know, I don't know how they'll grow up.""RELATED: 2016 Candidates React to Gay Marriage RulingThe Supreme Court's decision to strike down all gay marriage bans will also force conservative Christians and Republican political leaders to make two critical decisions.Will they acquiesce to this ruling, or continue to oppose gay marriage and fight to reverse this decision the way conservatives have battled against Roe v. Wade and abortion rights for a generation? And how they will they respond on other issues that involve the rights of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender Americans, such as allowing gay men to lead Boy Scout troops?Related: How Will Conservatives Respond to Gay Marriage Ruling?Republican 2016 candidates slammed the decision, with reactions ranging from dire warnings about the future of religious liberty to calls for mutual respect.Republican presidential candidate Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, an outspoken opponent of gay marriage, said in a lengthy statement that the decision ""will pave the way for an all out assault against the religious freedom rights of Christians who disagree with this decision.""""The Supreme Court decision today conveniently and not surprisingly follows public opinion polls, and tramples on states' rights that were once protected by the 10th Amendment of the Constitution,"" Jindal said. ""Marriage between a man and a woman was established by God, and no earthly court can alter that.""Pete Williams is an NBC News correspondent who covers the Justice Department and the Supreme Court, based in Washington.Halimah Abdullah is a digital editor and writer for NBC News and is responsible for reporting, writing, editing and web producing federal policy news for NBCNews.com.

 Somewhere in L.A., Whole Foods executives are laughing at all of us.A photo posted by Marielle Wakim (@marielle.m.n.o.p) on Aug 3, 2015 at 8:03am PDT We’re not experts, but this doesn’t seem like the best way to recover from an overpricing scandal, now does it?Here’s another questionable item that you can find at Whole Foods: $20 vinegar powder (a.k.a. the cocaine of vinegars). If vinegar powder and asparagus water isn’t yuppie bait, we don’t know what is.Meanwhile, people who like food and don’t have a trust fund out here like…Eater called up Whole Foods to get an explanation for why the grocery chain would charge customers $6 for asparagus in water. Here’s how the conversation went down,
The operator denied the product existed; eventually she transferred the call to a gentleman in the produce department who did not want to give his name. He explained that the product was new, “We’ve had them on the shelf for the last few days.” When asked how the new item is made, he said, “It’s water, and we sort of cut asparagus stalks down so they’re shorter, and put them into the container.” When Eater asked what it was for, there was a long pause before he said, “Well, it’s… to drink.” He elaborated, “The nutrients from the asparagus do transfer into the water.”

2173,"Youngest Suspect in Charlie Hebdo Attack Turns Himself In, 2 Others Sought","Gunmen shot victims ""execution style"" one by one, Paris deputy mayor says.Terror Attack in Paris Kills Twelve— -- The youngest suspect in today's deadly attack at a satirical newspaper's office in Paris has turned himself in, French police said, while the other two are “on the loose, armed and dangerous.""French authorities have named the three suspects who they believe are responsible for the shooting deaths of 12 people, U.S. law enforcement officials told ABC News.Officials identified the suspects as Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, two relatives both in their 30s and still at large, and 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, who police say is cooperating after his surrender in the French town of Charleville-Mezieres, about 140 miles north of Paris.Cherif Kouachi, 34, is listed in a private database, ABC News has confirmed.Kouachi, along with six others, was sentenced in May 2008 to 3 years in prison for terrorism in Paris. All seven men were accused of sending about a dozen young Frenchmen to join Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, after funneling them through radical religious establishments in Syria and Egypt. French authorities believed Kouachi had been planning to go to Syria for training in 2005.Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman earlier today told ABC News that two of the assailants went inside the offices of Charlie Hebdo and listed off the names of their targets before shooting them execution style. The third man was waiting outside the building.The French president called the attack a ""terrorist operation.""The shooting at the office of Charlie Hebdo was a ""cowardly attack,"" said President Francois Hollande when he was at the scene this morning.""This is a terrorist operation against an office that has been threatened several times, which is why it was protected,"" he said, without going into the specifics of the police protection at the office in the center of Paris. Photos from the scene show a police car riddled with bullet holes.The newspaper had been targeted in the past over its content, often aimed at religious groups.French officials confirmed that there are believed to be three attackers, all of whom were seen in videos wearing black from head-to-toe. Their identities and affiliations have not been revealed but one of the men is heard screaming ""Allahu Akbar,"" an Islamic phrase meaning ""God is great,"" in one of the scene videos.This morning's turmoil punctured an otherwise normal day in the French capital, with the gunshots audible from nearby buildings, sending bystanders cowering. The masked gunmen were later seen fleeing the scene and hijacked a car, authorities said. They have not been caught and a search is underway for the shooters.The tragedy marks France's deadliest terror attack in decades. The government raised its terror alert to the highest level and reinforced security at houses of worship, stores, media offices and transportation.The New York City Police Department ordered extra security to the French consulate in Manhattan and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said that they are closely monitoring the events in France and are ready to adjust their ""security posture, as appropriate.""Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper, has come under attack before. Their office was firebombed in 2011 and its website was hacked after its cover featured the prophet Muhammad. Nearly a year later, the publication again published crude Muhammad caricatures, drawing denunciations from around the Muslim world.The cover of this week's issue of the newspaper focuses on a new book by Michel Houellebecq, “Submission,” which depicts France led by an Islamic party that bans women from the workplace.President Obama condemned the ""outrageous"" attack.""France is America’s oldest ally, and has stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the fight against terrorists who threaten our shared security and the world,"" President Obama's statement read.

		5 escape after gunman with jihadist flag takes at least 15 hostage in Sydney cafe	","
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	SYDNEY — Five people escaped from a Sydney cafe where a gunman took an unknown number of hostages during Monday morning rush hour. Two people inside the cafe earlier held up a flag with an Islamic declaration of faith that has often been used by extremists, raising fears that a terrorist incident was playing out in the heart of Australia’s biggest city.The first three people ran out of the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in downtown Sydney six hours into the hostage crisis, and two women sprinted from a fire exit into the arms of waiting police shortly afterward. Both women were wearing aprons with the Lindt chocolate logo, indicating they were cafe employees.As the siege entered its 12th hour Monday night, basic questions remained unanswered. Police refused to say how many hostages were inside the cafe, what they believed the gunman’s motives might be, whether he had made any demands or whether the hostages who fled the cafe escaped or were released.“I would like to give you as much as I can but right now that is as much as I can,” New South Wales state police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said. “First and foremost, we have to make sure we do nothing that could in any way jeopardize those still in the building.”Police were negotiating with the gunman and said they had no information to suggest anyone had been hurt. Scipione said they had not confirmed whether the siege was related to terrorism.“Our only goal tonight and for as long as this takes is to get those people that are currently caught in that building out of there safely,” he said.Channel 10 news said it received a video in which a hostage inside the cafe had relayed the gunman’s demands. The station said police requested they not broadcast it, and Scipione separately asked all media that might be contacted by the gunman to urge him instead to talk to police.The drama began around 9:45 a.m. in Martin Place, a plaza in the heart of the city’s financial and shopping district that is packed with holiday shoppers this time of year. Many of those inside the cafe would have been taken hostage as they stopped in for their morning coffees.Television video shot through the cafe’s windows showed several people with their arms in the air and hands pressed against the glass, and two people holding up a black flag with the Shahada, or Islamic declaration of faith, written on it.The Shahada translates as “There is no god but God and Muhammad is his messenger.” It is considered the first of Islam’s five pillars of faith, and is similar to the Lord’s Prayer in Christianity. It is pervasive throughout Islamic culture, including the green flag of Saudi Arabia. Jihadis have used the Shahada in their own black flag.Seven Network television news staff watched the gunman and hostages for hours from a fourth floor window of their Sydney offices, opposite the cafe.The gunman could be seen pacing back and forth past the cafe’s four windows. Reporter Chris Reason said the man carried what appeared to be a pump-action shotgun, was unshaven and wore a white shirt and a black cap.Earlier in the day, network staff counted about 15 different faces among hostages forced up against the windows.“The gunman seems to be sort of rotating these people through these positions on the windows with their hands and faces up against the glass,” Reason said in a report from the vantage point. “One woman we’ve counted was there for at least two hours — an extraordinary, agonizing time for her surely having to stand on her feet for that long.”“When we saw that rush of escapees, we could see from up here in this vantage point the gunman got extremely agitated as he realized those five had got out. He started screaming orders at the people, the hostages who remain behind,” he added.Reason later reported that staff brought plates of food from a kitchen at the rear of the cafe and the hostages were fed.As night set in, the lights inside the cafe were switched off. Armed police guarding the area outside fitted their helmets with green-glowing night goggles.St. Vincent’s hospital spokesman David Faktor said a male hostage was in satisfactory condition in the hospital’s emergency department. He was the only one of the freed hostages to be taken to a hospital, and Scipione said he was being treated for a pre-existing condition.Hundreds of police blanketed the city, streets were closed and offices evacuated. The public was told to stay away from Martin Place, site of the state premier’s office, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the headquarters of two of the nation’s largest banks. The state parliament house is a few blocks away.Workers in the cordoned-off area were asked to stay home Tuesday, indicating police believe the hostage drama could stretch into the next day.“This is a very disturbing incident,” Prime Minister Tony Abbott said. “It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.”Lindt Australia posted a message on its Facebook page thanking the public for its support.“We are deeply concerned over this serious incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families,” the company wrote.Getty ImagesInfosys, India’s second-largest IT services provider, confirmed that one of its employees was among the hostages. The staffer’s family has been informed, it said.Australia’s government raised the country’s terror warning level in September in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of the Islamic State group. Counterterror law enforcement teams later conducted dozens of raids and made several arrests in Australia’s three largest cities — Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. One man arrested during a series of raids in Sydney was charged with conspiring with an Islamic State leader in Syria to behead a random person in downtown Sydney.The Islamic State group, which now holds a third of Syria and Iraq, has threatened Australia in the past. In September, Islamic State group spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani issued an audio message urging so-called “lone wolf” attacks abroad, specifically mentioning Australia. Al-Adnani told Muslims to kill all “disbelievers,” whether they be civilians or soldiers.One terrorism expert said the situation appeared to be that of a “lone wolf” making his own demands, rather than an attack orchestrated by a foreign jihadist group.“There haven’t been statements from overseas linking this to extremist groups outside the country — that is quite positive,” said Charles Knight, lecturer in the Department of Policing, Intelligence and Counter Terrorism at Australia’s Macquarie University. “The individual or individuals involved didn’t kill early, which is part of the pattern of some recent international attacks. … It seems to be shifting more into the model of a traditional hostage situation, rather than the sort of brutal attacks we’ve seen overseas.”Share Selection",2267626,11104,34703,1770,35,385,"1"

	Does This Photo Show a Syrian Child ‘Surrendering’ to a Camera?","As fear of refugees reached fever pitch in mid-November 2015, an old photo showing a child with her arms raised began recirculating around the internet.Syrian child holding her arms up in surrender because she thought the camera was a gun? Any idea if this is true?
The above-displayed photograph first went viral when it was shared on Twitter by journalist Nadia AbuShaban on 24 March 2015. While AbuShaban correctly identified the child as Syrian, many people doubted the authenticity of the photo since key information (such as the name of the photographer and the date the photo was taken) was missing.The BBC (with the help of an Imgur user) were able to trace the photo back to the Turkiye Newspaper. Turkish photojournalist, Osman Sağırlı explained that the above-displayed image was taken at the Atmeh refugee camp in Syria in December 2014 and shows a 4-year-old girl named Hudea who was afraid of the telephoto lens of his camera:  “I was using a telephoto lens, and she thought it was a weapon,” says Sağırlı. “İ realised she was terrified after I took it, and looked at the picture, because she bit her lips and raised her hands. Normally kids run away, hide their faces or smile when they see a camera.” He says he finds pictures of children in the camps particularly revealing. “You know there are displaced people in the camps. It makes more sense to see what they have suffered not through adults, but through children. It is the children who reflect the feelings with their innocence.”When the photograph was published by Turkiye in January 2015 it was accompanied by passage which gave a little more insight into Hudea’s life in a refugee camp:  Her face tightens immediately. She bites her lower lip and slowly raises her hands. She stands still without a word. It isn’t easy to console the child who thinks that the camera looking at her is a gun.Her name is Hudea… She is only 4 years old. She lost her dad in the bombing of Hama. She took refuge at the Atme camp at the Turkish border with her mom and [two] siblings.CompanyNavigateSectionsAccount© 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc.This material may not be reproduced without permission.Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com",298651,87,4008,1515,978,85830,"1"

2290,Manhunt continues for two French terror suspects,"PARIS — Authorities identified three suspects in a deadly shooting attack on a satirical newspaper that killed 12 people Wednesday as thousands jammed a public square for an evening vigil honoring victims of France's deadliest terror attack in a half century.Two of those killed were police officers, one of them shot dead on a sidewalk outside the newspaper. Eight journalists were among the victims.The suspects are two brothers — Said, 34, and Cherif Kouachi, 32, both French nationals — and Hamyd Mourad, 18, whose nationality wasn't known, a Paris police official told the Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The youngest suspect surrendered at a police station in Charleville-Mezieres, a small town in France's eastern Champagne region, Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said. French police early Thursday released photos of the brothers they were seeking, saying they should be considered armed and dangerous.French news media reported late Wednesday that a major police operation was taking place around an apartment building in Reims, about 90 miles northeast of Paris.The brothers were born in Paris of Algerian descent. Cherif was sentenced to three years in prison on terrorism charges in May 2008. Both brothers returned from Syria this summer.At least 15,000 gathered at the Place de la République for a vigil after the three gunmen, wearing hoods and armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles, stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo, shouting Islamic phrases and killing 12 people. The publication is a satirical newspaper that has caricatured the prophet Mohammed.""They wanted to put France down on its knees, but we will show them solidarity and unity,"" Ilan Scialom, 30, vice president of COEXISTER, an interfaith group in Paris that promotes tolerance, said at the Paris rally. Thousands turned out for similar vigils in Lyon and elsewhere across Europe. Some held signs saying, ""Not afraid.""There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the midday attack.Eight journalists, a guest and two police officers were killed, said Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, giving a partial breakdown of the dead. Among those killed were Bernard Maris, an economist who contributed to the newspaper and was heard regularly on French radio, and cartoonists Georges Wolinski and Berbard Verlhac, better known as Tignous.President Francois Hollande called the attack a terrorist act ""of exceptional barbarism,"" and said other attacks have been thwarted in France in recent weeks. Fears have been running high in France and elsewhere in Europe that jihadis returning from conflicts in Syria and Iraq will stage attacks at home.Cherif Kouachi was well known to French law enforcement. At 26, he was sentenced to three years in prison with 18 months suspended for criminal association with a terrorist enterprise for his conviction in 2008 as part of a group of seven men.Prosecutors said the group recruited French Muslims to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group, known as the 19th Arrondissement Network for the working class Paris district where it was based, allegedly recruited young men, arranged for weapons training and helped them travel though Syria to Iraq. Police arrested Kouachi in January 2005, days before he allegedly planned to travel to Syria.The rampage began around noon when the suspects killed a receptionist to gain entrance to the offices in central Paris, then opened fire on a second-floor editorial meeting, killing 10 people, Molins said. The officers were killed during the suspects' getaway, he said.Eleven others were injured, including four who were listed in serious condition.Molins said the attackers shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is great"") and the ""prophet is avenged"" before fleeing in a stolen black Citroen, exchanging gunfire at least twice with police outside.Cartoonist Corine Rey, also known as ""Coco,"" told the weekly Humanité that she was forced at gunpoint to allow the men inside the building.""They shot (cartoonists) Wolinski, Cabu … it lasted about five minutes,"" she told the newspaper, according to France24. ""I took cover under a desk. … They spoke perfect French. … They said they were al-Qaeda.""The dead included Stephane Charbonnier, the weekly newspaper's editorial director known as Charb, spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre of the Paris prosecutor's office confirmed. Charb's bodyguard — assigned to him after death threats — was among those killed, said Christophe Crepin, a police union spokesman. Four cartoonists whose work included controversial drawings of the prophet Mohammed were killed.In response to the death threats, Charb, according to France24, told colleagues at one point, ""I am not afraid of retaliation. I have no kids, no wife, no car, no credit. It perhaps sounds a bit pompous, but I prefer to die standing than living on my knees.""One police officer was shot execution-style on a sidewalk. The gunman, in a chilling video taken from a second-floor balcony, opened fire on a police officer, who collapsed. One of the gunmen then calmly walked up to the officer and killed him, before returning to the getaway car with his fellow assailant.The newspaper's editor, Gerard Biard, escaped the attack because he was in London.The publication, whose barbs are aimed at a wide range of religious and political institutions, has been heavily criticized by Muslims for years. In 2011, its offices were firebombed after a spoof issue featured a caricature of Mohammed on its cover.In Paris, as word of the killings spread, crowds gathered for an impromptu show of support at the Place de la République.By evening, Parisians huddled under the arm of the statue of the Glory of the Republic of France, clapped and chanted ""Charlie"" and ""Liberté."" Many held signs that read, ""Je suis Charlie"" (""I am Charlie""), while others held up pens to symbolize the freedom of the press.""I'm under shock, I think like all French journalists. I came here because I wanted to express my solidarity with Charlie and show my support for freedom of expression,"" said Sarah Halifa-Legrand, a reporter attending the vigil. ""There are so many people, everywhere in the square. Some have climbed up on the statue; people have lit up little candles. It's very touching. There's not so much noise, it's quiet. People are mourning. It's very moving.""In Washington, President Obama condemned the ""horrific shooting"" and said the United States was in touch with French officials ""to provide any assistance needed to help bring these terrorists to justice.""Secretary of State John Kerry called the incident a ""murderous attack"" and said ""each and every American"" stood beside France.The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers and the World Editors Forum condemned the assault.""An attack of this nature strikes at the heart of the very freedoms that the press in France so passionately defends,"" WAN-IFRA CEO Vincent Peyrègne said in a statement. ""It is not just an attack against the press, but also an attack on the fabric of our society and the values for which we all stand.""Welch reported from Los Angeles.
