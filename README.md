Early Detection of Fake News using Propagation Cascade Generation

# Inspiration for the topic
Early detection of fake news is crucial to the prevention of pervasive spread of fake news.
It has been shown using epidemic models that once a person or group is infected with fake news then it is very difficult to reverse the process.
To the best of out knowledge this would be the first attempt of its kind to generate propagation models for fake news.
